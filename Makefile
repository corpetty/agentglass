# `trap 'kill 0'` tears the whole process group (concurrently, bun --watch, the

# This said "what CI runs" and ran one of the six things CI runs. `make ci`
# below is the target that can honestly make that claim; this one is the fast
# half you run while working, and the timeout matches CI's for the same reason
# CI has it.
test: ## Run the server + web test suites (the fast half — `make ci` runs everything CI does)
	cd server && bun test --timeout 20000
	cd web && bun test

# Every step of both CI jobs, in the order .github/workflows/ci.yml declares
# them. `make smoke` and `make perf` are the same scripts those steps run, and
# smoke depends on `build`, which is CI's "Build web".
#
# `headcheck` is the one target here that CI does NOT have a step for, and on
# purpose: actions/checkout hands every job a pristine tree of the commit, so
# up there the typecheck steps below ARE the head check. Down here they are
# not — work-2026-08-05 is never pushed, and a dirty tree is its normal state.
# It goes first because it is the cheapest thing in this list and the only one
# that can fail on something none of the others can see.

# how a commit passed here and failed there; run this before pushing. Needs
# Docker; logs go to ~/.cache/agentglass-ci-docker/out.

# ONE command for the question `bun test` cannot answer.
#
# Two type errors reached this branch in a day and were found hours later, by
# hand: `Bun.serve` types `port` as optional, and `res.json()` returns
# `unknown`. Both suites were green throughout, because bun STRIPS types rather
# than checking them — `bun test` says nothing at all about tsc, and neither
# does vite build.
#
# The pieces already existed and this invents none of them: every package has
# had a `typecheck` script all along. What did not exist was one thing to run
# that fails when ANY of them does. `make typecheck` leaves mobile out, `make
# test` leaves mobile out too, and mobile's types were only ever checked inside
# `make mobile-test`, behind an `npm ci` that deletes and rebuilds its
# node_modules — too slow to run before a commit, so nobody ran it.
#
# Types first, and the cheap ones first, because a type error is seconds and a
# suite is minutes. Measured on this machine: the three typechecks together are
# about 40s, the server suite alone is ~4.5min. Failing fast is the difference
# between a check that gets run and one that gets skipped.
#
# MOBILE'S TYPES ARE OPTIONAL HERE, deliberately. `mobile/` is not a bun
# workspace member (the root names server, web and electron), it installs with
# its own `npm ci`, and its node_modules is gitignored — so a worktree a task
# just cut has none, and mobile's own `tsc` is not there to run. Measured: `npm
# run typecheck` exits 127, which is "command not found", not a type error.
# Failing on that would make this command unrunnable in exactly the tree where
# somebody is about to commit, so it says what it skipped and why, in one line
# — the same bargain mobile's own tests already make (mobile/test/npm-deps.ts).
# `make mobile-test` stays the one that checks mobile properly, and CI runs it.
#
# The binary is looked for at mobile/node_modules/.bin/tsc rather than asked
# for by name: mobile is outside the workspaces, so npm puts its local bin
# exactly there and nowhere else. That is a path this repo's layout guarantees,
# unlike the path of a hoisted dependency.
# Lint and the logo sync run first, as they do in CI: the cheapest steps of the
# job, and two v0.20.0 reds came from them while this target stayed green.

# `bun run typecheck`, not `bunx tsc`: bunx downloads the newest published
# TypeScript when the directory has none, which is how server/ ended up being
# checked by 7.0.2 while web/ used 5.9.3. Both declare it now, and `bun run`
# fails loudly instead of fetching. web's script covers src AND test/.
# electron/ joined the list the day it got `// @ts-check`. It is .js, not .ts,
# and for years that meant the file that mints the auth token and registers
# every IPC channel was the one file here nothing checked at all — the two
# halves this target used to name were the typed ones.

# The target above reads your DESK. This one reads the COMMIT, and they are not

# commit is what everyone else actually gets.
#
# 5d2ac02 is why it exists. A `git add -A` in the shared worktree committed
# another session's *use* of a `PanesResponse` type without its declaration, and
# `bun run typecheck` stayed green in every tree on the machine for a day —
# everyone had the good shared/types.ts uncommitted on disk. It was found by
# accident. `make headcheck REF=5d2ac02` still fails on it, in 9 seconds.
