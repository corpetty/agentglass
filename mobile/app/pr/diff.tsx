/*
 * The diff, one file at a time, with somewhere to say something about a line.
 *
 * ── unified, never side-by-side ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * 393 points cannot hold two columns of code. Split view is the desktop's and
 * belongs there; here the two sides interleave and the line numbers carry the
 * distinction, which is the arrangement every terminal diff has used since
 * before there were columns to split.
 *
 * ── the comments queue, and that is the point ────────────────────────────
 * Nothing is posted as it is written. Comments accumulate on the device and go
 * with the verdict in ONE call to `/prs/review-with`, so a phone that loses
 * signal halfway cannot leave half a review on somebody's pull request — three
 * remarks with no conclusion, which reads as an opinion nobody finished.
 *
 * It is also the shape GitHub actually wants: a review IS a verdict plus its
 * comments, and posting them one at a time makes a thread per remark.
 *
 * ── the lines the hunk cut off ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * A hunk shows three lines of context and the question you have is usually
 * about the twentieth. At a desk that is answered by the editor next to the
 * browser; here there was no editor, so the answer was "open GitHub". The
 * expanders between hunks fetch the real file from `/prs/file-slice`, one
 * screen at a time. Those lines are context and cannot be commented on —
 * GitHub only accepts a comment on a line the diff touches, and drawing them
 * as pressable would be offering something that fails on send.
 *
 * ── the whole diff arrives as one string ─────────────────────────────────
 * `/prs/diff` answers with the output of `gh pr diff`. Parsing it is
 * src/model/diffLines.ts, which is where the line-number arithmetic and its
 * tests live — a comment anchored to the wrong line is a remark about code the
 * author did not write.
