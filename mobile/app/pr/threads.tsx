/*
 * The conversations on a pull request, answered from the phone.
 *
 * ── what this replaces ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A line on the detail screen that said "Reading them is on GitHub for now".
 * That sentence was the honest description of a review you could start on the
 * phone and could not finish: you could write remarks on the diff and send a
 * verdict, but the moment somebody replied to one, the app had nothing to say
 * and handed you to a browser, signed out, on a page built for a mouse.
 *
 * Three things happen here, and each is one call the server already served for
 * the desk:
 *
 *   reply           `/prs/reply`            — into the thread, not as a new one
 *   resolve         `/prs/thread-resolved`  — and unresolve, the same button
 *   apply           `/prs/apply-suggestion` — commit the suggested lines
 *
 * ── replies post immediately, and the diff's comments do not ─────────────
 * This looks like an inconsistency and is the opposite of one. A line comment
 * is part of a REVIEW — a verdict plus its remarks, which GitHub takes in one
 * call, and which reviewDraft.ts queues precisely so that a dropped connection
 * cannot leave three observations with no conclusion. A reply is not part of
 * anything: it is one message into a conversation that already exists, it
 * stands on its own, and holding it back until some later verdict would be
 * holding an answer somebody is waiting for.
 *
 * ── applying a suggestion writes a commit to somebody's branch ───────────
 * So it asks first, and it says whose branch and which lines. The parsing —
 * which block, which range — is `shared/suggestion.ts`, and the range comes
 * from the THREAD rather than from anything in the block, because that is how
 * GitHub defines it. An outdated thread offers no Apply at all: the lines it
 * was written about are gone, and the number it still carries now points at
 * something nobody was talking about.
