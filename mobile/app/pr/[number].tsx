/*
 * One pull request, read and acted on without leaving the app.
 *
 * This screen is the answer to the thing the phone did instead: tapping a row
 * called `Linking.openURL` and handed you to Safari, signed out, on a page
 * built for a mouse. Everything below arrives in ONE call to `/prs/detail` —
 * body, checks, files, threads, commits — which the server already answered
 * and nothing on the phone ever asked.
 *
 * ── what it does not try to be ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Not the diff, and not the whole conversation. Both are real screens and both are
 * bigger than this one; what belongs here is the question you open a pull
 * request to answer on a phone — is this alright, and if not, what is wrong
 * with it. Files are a list with their weights, threads are a count, and the
 * way to the whole thing on GitHub is at the bottom rather than the top.
 *
 * ── the button that matters ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * "Hand to Claude" is why any of this exists. It does NOT post a prompt: it
 * puts `{cmd:"review", number, root, recipe}` on the terminal's socket, the
 * server looks that recipe id up in its own catalogue, builds the text, opens
 * a tmux window running the agent, and switches the pane. The socket carries an
 * intent and never a command line — see src/model/reviewMenu.ts for why that
 * shape is load-bearing rather than incidental.
