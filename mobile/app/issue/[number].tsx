 * One issue, read on a phone.
 *
 * Pushed onto the root stack rather than mounted as a tab, the way the
 * conversation used to be: it is entered from a list and left again, and
 * nothing else navigates to it.
 *
 * ── what this screen is for, and what it is not ───────────────────────────
 * It is for deciding. An issue is the one kind of work that arrives with no
 * branch behind it, so the question is always the same — is this mine, has
 * anybody started it, and is there already a pull request that closes it. All
 * three are answered above the fold and none of them are in the title.
 *
 * `/issues/prs` is a SECOND round trip on purpose: the server's own comment
 * says the description should not wait on GitHub answering twice. So the body
 * paints immediately and the linked pull requests fill in under it, which is
 * the same two-pass shape the pull request list already uses for its checks.
