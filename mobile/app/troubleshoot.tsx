/*
 * Why something is not working, from the phone.
 *
 * ── the gap this fills ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Half the screens in this app have a red note on them that names a missing
 * tool: "the GitHub CLI (gh) is not installed", "tmux has to have a client
 * attached", "ClickUp is not connected". Each is correct and each is the end
 * of the road — the phone cannot install anything, and until now it could not
 * even say what ELSE was missing, so the answer to "why is half of this grey"
 * meant walking to the computer to find out.
 *
 * `/dependencies` is the same answer the desktop's own panel draws, and it has
 * been a GET the whole time. This screen is that list, plus the two facts the
 * phone alone knows: whether it can reach the machine at all, and what it was
 * granted when it paired.
 *
 * ── it does not offer to fix anything ────────────────────────────────────
 * Deliberately. Every remedy here is a package install on somebody else's
 * computer, and a phone that could run those would be a phone that can run
 * arbitrary commands as whoever owns the machine — which is precisely the
 * grant this app spends its scope rules refusing. The install line is SHOWN so
 * it can be read out or copied; running it is done where the machine is.
 *
 * ── read-only, so it works when nothing else does ────────────────────────
 * Both reads are GETs, which is the point: the moment somebody wants this
 * screen is the moment something is refusing them, and a diagnostic that
 * needed `full` would be unavailable exactly when a `read` phone is trying to
 * work out why it is a `read` phone.
