/*
 * The cards, from the tracker you actually use.
 *
 * ── which tracker ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This screen read `/clickup/views` and `/clickup/view` whoever you were. On a
 * machine that tracks work in its own local store it drew an empty board and
 * offered to open cards in a product nobody there used. `useTaskProvider`
 * answers the question the screen should have asked (model/taskProviders.ts
 * has the rule): ClickUp connected is the board below; any other tracker set
 * up is `/tasks/list`, the provider-neutral route, drawn as the local rows in
 * `LocalRow`; nothing set up is said in words.
 *
 * ── the board ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The views are the workspace's own — whatever was added on the desk, in the
 * order it was added — because a phone that shows a different slice of the
 * board than the computer is a second place to keep in your head.
 *
 * Status is drawn in the colour the workspace gave it and spelled the way the
 * workspace spells it. Renaming somebody's workflow is not ours to do, and a
 * board's colours are how its people read it at a glance. What the app decides
 * for itself is only `statusKind` — open, done, other — because status NAMES
 * are per-list and a workspace may have four words for "doing", so nothing may
 * branch on them.
