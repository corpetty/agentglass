/*
 * The machine's real terminals, as tabs.
 *
 * Not "a shell on the phone" — the shells that are already running. Every tab
 * is a live tmux pane on the computer, so opening one shows what is on that
 * screen right now: the agent mid-turn, the build that failed, the rebase
 * waiting on a decision. That is the difference between a companion and a
 * second empty prompt.
 *
 * Attaching does not disturb the desk. tmux sizes a window to whichever client
 * used it last, so the obvious `attach` would drag a 200-column session down to
 * phone width for as long as you looked at it — measured, and it is why the
 * server joins as its own grouped session with `window-size largest`. See
 * `attachArgvFor`.
 *
 * The key bar below is the other half. A software keyboard has letters; a
 * terminal needs Escape, Tab, the arrows, ^C and — since these are tmux panes —
 * the tmux prefix. Without those the phone can run `ls` and nothing else.
 *
 * ── why there is a composer and not a cursor ──────────────────────────────
 * Typing used to mean tapping a bar that called `focus()` on the terminal,
 * which focused xterm's hidden textarea inside the WebView and hoped Android
 * would raise the keyboard. Android does not: an Android WebView shows the IME
 * for a focus that came from a real touch on the element, and the prop that
 * overrides that, `keyboardDisplayRequiresUserAction`, is marked `@platform
 * ios` in react-native-webview's own types. So the bar did nothing at all.
 *
 * It would have been the wrong shape even had it worked. The keyboard covers
 * most of a phone, so typing straight into the pane is typing blind at the two
 * lines still showing. The field below is a composer instead: you write a line
 * where you can see it, and it goes to the pane with a carriage return after
 * it, which is the bargain the agent's own prompt makes. `keys` mode is there
 * for the other half of a terminal, the program waiting on one keystroke.

   *   `fit` off: tmux holds the window at the desk's width and the phone sees
   *   a slice of it. Fitting to the phone would be about 45 columns onto a
   *   200-column pane, which for anything full-screen is border and a prompt.
   *
   *   `fit` on, which is a tap and not the default: the window becomes
   *   whatever this page reports, so this IS the pane's width — at the desk
   *   too, while you are looking. 80 is what every TUI has been written
   *   against since terminals were furniture, and the one width nothing is
   *   surprised by.
   *
   * 80 is also the widest that is still comfortably legible — the arithmetic
   * is unforgiving, and worth writing down rather than rediscovering. A phone
   * WebView is ~400 CSS pixels across and a monospace glyph is ~0.6 of its
   * point size, so N columns means a font of 400/N/0.6: 80 gives 8.3pt, 120
   * gives 5.5pt, and 200 gives 3.3pt, which is a texture rather than text.
   *
   * So the cycle is 60 / 80 — read, and work.
   *
   * 200 was on this cycle and is gone. The arithmetic above says why: it lands
   * under the font floor, so the glyphs stop shrinking and start OVERLAPPING —
   * reported from a phone as "text on top of other text", which is exactly what
   * a grid wider than its floor allows looks like. A rung nobody can read is a
   * rung that only costs taps to get past.
   *
   * AND SO IS 120, for a sharper reason than "small". Measured in a real engine
   * at this phone's 412 CSS px: 60 columns gives a 6.85px cell at 11.4pt, 80
   * gives 5.15px at 8.55pt, and 120 gives 3.43px at 5.7pt — above the font floor,
   * so nothing overlaps and the screenshot looks like tiny text. It is not tiny
   * text. At 3.43px the glyph is clipped inside its own cell and characters
   * change identity: in the same capture `#472` read as `#4/2`, `#467` as
   * `#46/` and `faf0e9d` as `tat0e9d` — a seven drawn without its bar is a
   * slash, an f without its crossbar is a t. A width control that misreports the
   * commit somebody is looking at is worse than one that does not offer that

   * `keys` used to send the WHOLE field on every change and keep the field
   * empty by controlling its value to a constant "". Emptying it is a render,
   * and a render is not synchronous with a thumb: the next character arrives
   * while the native input still holds the last one, so the change event
   * carries both and the whole buffer goes down the socket again. Measured on
   * the emulator against a pane running `cat -v`, typing `hello` at ordinary
   * speed: the pane received `hhehelhello`. Typed with 1.2s between characters
   * the same field was correct, which is the whole tell — the slow case is the
   * one where the render always won the race.
   *
   * So the field is no longer emptied while anybody is typing, and what is sent
   * is the DIFFERENCE — `editFor`, the same function the line mirror uses. The
   * field and the record of what has been sent are then one clock instead of
   * two, and no amount of typing speed can put them out of step.
   *
   * It also gives `keys` a backspace that works. That key never reached the
   * pane: `onKeyPress` was the only path and Android does not fire it for
   * Backspace on an empty soft-keyboard field — measured, `xyz` on the pane was
   * still `xyz` after two presses. A field that holds what you typed reports a
   * backspace as an ordinary change, and `editFor` turns it into the DEL a
   * terminal's erase key sends.
   *
   * Cleared on blur and on the mode switch, and DELIBERATELY NOT on Enter. Both
   * of those are moments when nothing is being typed, which is the only moment
   * an asynchronous clear is safe; clearing on Enter would put the same race
   * back at the boundary between a command and the next one. What it costs is a

   * Re-read the panes while this screen is on screen, and only then.
   *
   * The reported bug: split a pane at the computer, or open a window, and the
   * phone went on showing the strip it read on mount — the refresh arrow was
   * the only way to see it. The desk does not have the problem because the
   * server sweeps tmux twice a second and pushes it a `t:"tmux"` frame; this
   * phone holds a socket too, but it only ever carries `events`, `notify` and
   * pty bytes. Nothing on it says the panes changed.
   *
   * So: poll, rather than add a frame. A new event type is server work plus a
   * thing to keep in step across two branches, and that has already produced
   * one visible bug today; a GET this screen already makes is neither.
   *
   * TWO SECONDS, and the cost is what picks it rather than taste. `listPanes`
   * is synchronous `tmux` calls — list-clients, list-panes, list-sessions per
   * socket — on Bun's single event loop, so the request is not free at the
   * server end and everything else queues behind it. Measured against the
   * machine this was reported on, 17 panes across its tmux servers: 24 ms per
   * call and 3.5 KB of JSON back. At 2s that is ~1.2% of the server's event
   * loop and ~1.7 KB/s, and the terminal's own pty bytes wait behind those
   * 24 ms — at 1s it would be double both. What is being watched for is a hand
   * on a keyboard splitting a pane, which happens once and not twice a second,
   * so half the cost is worth the beat. Radio and battery barely enter into it:
   * whenever this poll is running the screen is also holding a WebSocket
   * streaming a live pane, so it is a request added to a radio that is already
   * awake rather than one that wakes it.
   *
   * What it feels like, measured on the emulator against a tmux of its own:
   * `split-window` at 20:21:19.9 was on the phone by the poll at 20:21:21.5,
   * and `new-window` landed inside the same two seconds. Thirty-three ticks in
   * a row came out 2.02s apart with the strip unchanged, and not one of them
   * wrote state — which is the half `readStrip` is responsible for.
   *
   * `useFocusEffect` and not `useEffect`: a tab screen stays MOUNTED when you
   * leave it, so an effect keyed on mount would go on polling from the Chats
   * screen, from Settings, and behind a locked phone. Focus is the honest

        The other half of the same fact, and the one that was missing.

        `fit` off is sold as "the window keeps the desk's size", and when nobody
        wider is attached that is not what happens: `window-size largest` sizes
        the window to whichever client is biggest, and on a session the desk is
        not sitting in, that client is this phone. So the width control below
        reflows the real window whether or not `fit` is on, and there is nothing
        to take back — the phone already has it.

        THIS IS THE STRIP THAT LIED, and what changed is not its wording. It
        claimed "nothing wider is looking at this window" off a comparison
        between the one size the server had ever sent and the width this page
        was showing when it sent it — which at a fresh attach agree because the
        desk is 80 and the default is 80, not because anything was measured.
        With a real 80-column client attached and the phone at 60 it therefore
        asserted the opposite of the truth while columns 61 to 80 fell off the
        right-hand edge with no way to reach them. `grid` now carries the
        window's real size after every resize (see the `pane` frame's
        `by: "phone"`), so `following` is a measurement and the two strips
        cannot both be wrong about the same window.

        It only speaks under 80 because that is where it starts to cost
        something. 80 is what every TUI is written against; below it a window
        split in two or four gives its panes twenty-odd columns each, which is
        where an agent's prompt box stops being a box. Measured at 60: the four
        panes of a live window were 23, 36, 23 and 36 columns.

        The tap goes to 80 rather than toggling `fit`, because `fit` is not the
        control that is doing this and offering it would be the third wrong
        thing this strip has said.

        The new tab, as a choice rather than a silent default.

        `+` used to start Claude with permission prompts OFF, every time, with
        the whole of that decision living in an accessibility label nobody
        hears. That is the most consequential press on this screen — it is an
        agent let loose in a checkout — and it was the one with no dialog.

        The list is what the MACHINE reports, not what this app can imagine.
        `/terminal/agents` answers with `installed` per row, so a CLI that is
        not there is drawn greyed and says so, rather than being offered and
        failing after the window has already opened — which on a phone is a
        blank pane on a computer you are not sitting at.

        Permissions are a second press, not a switch on the row. A row that
        launches and a toggle that arms are two different gestures, and putting
        them in one control is how somebody means to read the list and starts
        an agent instead.
