        Each left it for a reason and each is still one tap away. Repos was a
        screen that said "Nothing changed here" most days on a machine that
        works a worktree per pull request, and it was spending a fifth of the
        bar on that. The queue and the plan are both about AGENTS, and the
        Inbox is now only about pull requests, issues and cards — so the queue
        is a row here and the plan is the card under this one.

        The queue also has a louder door: a band appears at the bottom of the
        terminal whenever something is actually held. This row is the one that
        is always here, for when you want to go and look rather than be told.
