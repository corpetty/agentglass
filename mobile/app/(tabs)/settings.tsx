 * the queue, the working tree). The plan is the chip on every header now, the
 * queue is answered in the terminal, and Source control opens from the
 * terminal it belongs to. What stayed is what somebody comes here to change.
 *
 * The scope is not editable here and never will be: it was chosen at the
 * computer by somebody looking at the request, and a phone that could widen its
 * own grant would make that choice decorative. It is said, in the computer's
 * sheet, with what would change it.
 *
 * The terminal's width and keyboard help moved here from the key bar's screen:
 * they are preferences, and the key bar screen is about the keys.

              off, which is what silently dropped alerts that arrived while the
              phone was in a pocket — measured on the emulator, the live socket
              in src/lib/live.ts died 3-6s after HOME. The switch above is what
              keeps that connection open; without it, this is what happens.
              Only drawn next to the switch it names: on iOS, in Expo Go, or
              with alerts off there is no such switch, and this used to claim
              one anyway. */}
