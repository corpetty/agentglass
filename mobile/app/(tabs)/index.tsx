/*
 * The Inbox: what is waiting on you, from the three places work arrives from.
 *
 * Pull requests, issues and cards. NOTHING about agents — not a held gate, not
 * a stopped session, not the plan meter. The rule and the argument for it are
 * in src/model/inbox.ts; what this file adds is that the rule is visible in
 * the imports, which carry no session or gate type at all.
 *
 * ── what was here, and why it went ────────────────────────────────────────
 * A list of running agents under a band that counted `waitingItems`. That
 * rule calls a session "waiting on you" when it has been quiet between four
 * minutes and twelve hours, so on a real machine it read "4 things want you"
 * over four rows last touched 21 minutes, 6 hours, 10 hours and 10 hours ago.
 * It titled them with `sessionTitle`, whose fallback for a hook-only session
 * is `source_app:id.slice(0,8)` — so the four rows said `orbit:3f9c1a04`.
 *
 * Everything an agent is doing is now read where it is running, in the
 * terminal behind the star. A gate that is held raises a band there, not here.
 *
 * ── three numbers, then one list ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * The tiles are a summary and the list is the detail, in that order, because
 * this screen is scanned rather than read. They are counted from the rows
 * underneath them — `inboxCounts` takes the built list — so a tile cannot
 * disagree with what it is sitting on top of, which is the failure the old
 * band shipped with.
