/*
 * Pull requests, across every repository at once.
 *
 * ── all of them, then narrowed ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * The screen used to show ONE repository, picked from a sheet behind the
 * title, which meant the question "is anything waiting on me" had to be asked
 * once per repository. It opens on all of them now, grouped under each
 * repository's name, and a row of chips narrows it to one.
 *
 * Capped at the eight most recently touched repositories, and the cap is a
 * real limit stated rather than hidden: each costs a GitHub-backed request per
 * filter, and a machine with thirty would spend a minute of radio to draw a
 * list whose bottom nobody scrolls to. Picking a chip reaches any of them.
 *
 * ── the row ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Three lines, each answering one of the questions that decide whether it is
 * opened: the title beside a mark that says what CI thinks; the review and
 * the checks as chips, with the size; and whose it is, how old, and its
 * number. The words and tones are decided in model/prLook.ts.
