/*
 * The conversations on a pull request, answered from the phone.
 *
 * ── what this replaces ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A line on the detail screen that said "Reading them is on GitHub for now".
 * That sentence was the honest description of a review you could start on the
 * phone and could not finish: you could write remarks on the diff and send a
 * verdict, but the moment somebody replied to one, the app had nothing to say
 * and handed you to a browser, signed out, on a page built for a mouse.
 *
 * ── this is the list; the diff has the same thing on the line ────────────
 * A conversation is answered here or under the row of code it is about, and
 * both draw `review/ThreadCard.tsx` and act through `useThreadActions` — the
 * three writes and the re-read after them live there. What is left in this
 * file is the list: which threads, in what order, and what to say when there
 * are none.
 *
 * ── replies post immediately, and the diff's comments do not ─────────────
 * This looks like an inconsistency and is the opposite of one. A line comment
 * is part of a REVIEW — a verdict plus its remarks, which GitHub takes in one
 * call, and which reviewDraft.ts queues precisely so that a dropped connection
 * cannot leave three observations with no conclusion. A reply is not part of
 * anything: it is one message into a conversation that already exists, it
 * stands on its own, and holding it back until some later verdict would be
 * holding an answer somebody is waiting for.
