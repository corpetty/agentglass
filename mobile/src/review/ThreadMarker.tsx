/*
 * A conversation, unopened, under the line it is about.
 *
 * The diff is eleven-point monospace at 22 points a row, and a thread card
 * dropped into the middle of it unasked would bury the code the thread is
 * about. So it starts as one line: who said it, roughly what, and how many
 * replies came after — enough to decide whether to open it, which is the only
 * decision a marker is for.
 *
 * It takes the full 44-point target even though the rows around it are 22.
 * The line under it is a line of code and has the argument written in
 * test/tap-floor.test.ts; this is a control, and a mis-tap on a control that
 * expands a card is a card that covers what you were reading.
