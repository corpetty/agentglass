/*
 * The bar: four destinations, the terminal first.
 *
 * Written by hand rather than configured, because the stock bar pads each item
 * and centres a label under an icon, and this one draws the active destination
 * as a filled indicator behind its icon — the Material 3 shape, and the one
 * Android people already read as "you are here". Everything else is the stock
 * bar's behaviour reproduced deliberately: the tabPress event a listener can
 * prevent, the labels left free to scale, the bottom inset paid once.
 *
 * ── it was retired, and why it came back ─────────────────────────────────
 * For a while there was no bar: the Inbox was where the app arrived and every
 * other screen was a place it sent you, with a way back in each header. That
 * made every move between two destinations two moves, through a screen nobody
 * came for. The four are peers, and a bar is 64 points plus the gesture inset
 * well spent on peers — and handed back while typing, below.
 *
 * ── the keyboard ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The bar is a flex sibling of the scene, so a window that resizes carries it
 * up to sit mid-screen over the list (API 34, photographed) and a window that
 * does not leaves it buried under the keys (API 36, photographed). React
 * Navigation's own answer, `tabBarHideOnKeyboard`, is read inside ITS bar and
 * this app draws its own, so the option is a no-op here and the rule has to be
 * in this file. While a keyboard is up the bar is not drawn at all.
 *
 * ── the two numbers, and the two it does not carry ────────────────────────
 * Terminal counts the gates held on you and PRs counts the reviews requested
 * of you. Both are lists the store already holds for every screen, so the
 * numbers cost nothing to keep current and cannot go stale on one screen while
 * another is right.
 *
 * Issues and cards carry none. Each would be another request on a component
 * that is mounted on every screen, and a number built from what happens to be
 * loaded would UNDERCOUNT silently, by exactly the rows it could not see — and
 * the one thing a badge cannot afford is to be a number nobody believes.
