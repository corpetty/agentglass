/*
 * Where the app can be gone to, and which of those places the bar offers.
 *
 * Data, with no React in it, because the shape of the navigation is the thing
 * worth locking down and a component is not checkable — see test/nav.test.ts,
 * which asserts the arithmetic below rather than repeating it.
 *
 * ── four peers, and the terminal first ────────────────────────────────────
 * The app used to open on an Inbox: a heading, three counters and a list of
 * the other screens. It was built as the hub the rest hung off, and in use it
 * was the screen between you and the one you came for. The phone is opened to
 * look at an agent, a pull request, an issue or a card, and those four are
 * peers somebody moves between — which is what a bar is for, and what the
 * Inbox's list of destinations was a slower copy of.
 *
 * So the bar is back, and the Inbox, the Now screen and the More sheet that
 * held Now, Source control and Settings are gone:
 *
 *   What the Inbox counted is on the bar itself: a gate waiting on you is a
 *   number on Terminal and a review requested of you is a number on PRs, both
 *   from lists the phone already holds (see TabBar.tsx for why issues and
 *   cards carry none).
 *
 *   Now's held gates are answered where the agent is, in the terminal — and
 *   on a phone that may not type, the Terminal screen is where they are
 *   listed instead of a pane.
 *
 *   Source control and Files belong to a checkout, so they open from the
 *   terminal's menu, in the checkout that pane is in. Settings is the gear on
 *   every destination's header.
 *
 * ── the width rule ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The bar is drawn by hand (TabBar.tsx) and each item is an equal share of the
 * width with no padding of its own, so a label has screen / N to live in. At
 * seven, react-navigation's own bar left "Terminal" 41.4dp on a 360dp phone and
 * it lost that at Android's first text-size notch; the five-item bar that
 * followed was sized against the same arithmetic. Four is the count now, the
 * labels are 12 points instead of 10, and test/nav.test.ts holds every word to
 * a measured width.

 * refused this token" is not "you do not use ClickUp", and the Cards screen is
