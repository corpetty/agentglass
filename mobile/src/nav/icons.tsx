 * Every mark the navigation draws, as geometry the app carries itself.
 *
 * They used to be single characters — ◎ for Now, ⑂ for pull requests, ⚙ for
 * settings — and on the phone several of them came out as empty boxes, because
 * Android's system font carries no glyph for them and the fallback chain runs
 * out. That is not a styling complaint: it is a bar where several destinations
 * have no mark at all until you read the label under them.
 *
 * They are drawn in the desk rail's coordinate system — a 24-unit box, see
 * web/src/components/workspace/icons.tsx — and several of them are that rail's
 * own shapes, unaltered. A pull request should not be one thing on the computer
 * and a different one in your hand. Four are the rail's (Terminal, Prs,
 * Repos, Tasks), one is GitHub's own (Issues), and the rest are the phone's,
 * each for a reason written over it.
 *
 * They live here rather than in the tab bar because the bar is not what draws
 * most of them. Four are its destinations; the gear and the way back are in
 * the header over a destination or a pushed screen, the chevron ends a row
 * that opens something, and the rest are the terminal's own controls.
