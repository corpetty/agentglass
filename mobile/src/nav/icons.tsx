 * Every mark the navigation draws, as geometry the app carries itself.
 *
 * They used to be single characters — ◎ for Now, ⑂ for pull requests, ⚙ for
 * settings — and on the phone several of them came out as empty boxes, because
 * Android's system font carries no glyph for them and the fallback chain runs
 * out. That is not a styling complaint: it is a bar where several destinations
 * have no mark at all until you read the label under them.
 *
 * They are drawn in the desk rail's coordinate system — a 24-unit box, see
 * web/src/components/workspace/icons.tsx — and several of them are that rail's
 * own shapes, unaltered. A pull request should not be one thing on the computer
 * and a different one in your hand. Of the twelve below, four are the rail's
 * (Terminal, Prs, Repos/FilesIcon, Tasks/IssuesIcon), one is GitHub's own
 * (Issues), and the rest are the phone's, each for a reason written over it.
 *
 * They live here rather than in the tab layout because the bar is not what
 * draws most of them. Five of the twelve were tabs — Inbox, Prs, Terminal,
 * Issues, Tasks. The other five are somewhere else entirely: the faders and the
 * way back are in the header the tab layout puts over a pushed screen, the
 * chevron is on every Inbox row, and the ring and the folder are the two rows
 * in Settings ▸ Elsewhere, which is where Now and Repos went when the bar
 * became pull requests, issues and cards.
