/*
 * What the phone is wearing: a mode, an accent, and the palette they make.
 *
 * Dark / Light / System, crossed with one of seven accents. That is the desk's
 * idea without the desk's catalogue — thirty-seven palettes is a thing you
 * browse at a monitor, not a thing you want in a settings screen in one hand —
 * and the two base palettes ARE two of the desk's: github-dark and github-light,
 * imported from shared/palettes.ts rather than picked again here.
 *
 * ── what this replaced, and why ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * The phone used to wear whatever theme the computer was on: it asked
 * `GET /theme/current` on every foreground and repainted from the answer. That
 * cannot coexist with a phone that has its own mode — they are two answers to
 * one question, and the machine's answer arrived LAST, so choosing Light on the
 * phone and then putting it in a pocket would have brought the desk's dark
 * theme back on the way out. Mirroring loses; the phone's own choice is the
 * whole answer. The cost is real and worth naming: a desk on Dracula no longer
 * tints the phone. What it buys is that the two Settings screens now say true
 * things, and a desk on GitHub Dark is pixel-identical to a phone on Dark.
 *
 * ── why this is a mutable module object ───────────────────────────────────
 * On the web this is `:root { --bg: … }` — one global, read at paint time by
 * everything, replaced wholesale on a theme change. React Native has no such
 * thing, and the alternative is threading a palette through every component
 * that needs a border colour, which is most of them.
 *
 * So `C` is that global: read at render time, replaced by `setLook`, with a
 * subscription the root layout uses to re-render the tree.
 *
 * That is also why the system watcher below is `Appearance` and not the
 * `useColorScheme` hook. The hook answers a component; this answers the module
 * every component reads, and one subscription that outlives every screen is
 * what the singleton needs — including on the terminal screen, which must be
 * repainted without being remounted (see TerminalView).
 *
 * ── why the two native modules are required lazily ────────────────────────
 * Because this file is where a palette comes from, and things that are not a
 * phone want one: two suites read `C` to build a terminal document with. A
 * static `import … from "react-native"` at the top of it made `bun test` throw
 * on a Flow type annotation inside react-native's own index.js — in a suite
 * about the composer, which has nothing to do with the theme. Required inside a
 * function they are absent rather than fatal, and the app is unaffected: the
 * only difference off a phone is that there is no OS to ask and nothing to
 * remember, which is exactly right.
