/*
 * What a pull request's row says, decided apart from the row.
 *
 * Three questions are answered on the row itself, because they decide whether
 * it is opened at all: is CI red, where is the review, and how big is it. The
 * row draws them as a mark, two chips and a size; these decide the words and
 * tones, so they can be tested without a renderer.
 *
 * The check rollup arrives on a SECOND pass — it costs about four times the
 * rest of the row — so a row that has not had it says "checks…" rather than
 * "no checks". Those are different claims and only one of them is true at that
 * moment.
