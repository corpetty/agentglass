/*
 * What a held gate says about itself, in the words a card draws.
 *
 * A gate is an agent stopped at a tool call until somebody answers. The card
 * has three things to say and they are not the same thing: WHERE it is (the
 * checkout and the window, which the server composes because only it knows the
 * pane), WHAT it wants (the tool, as a verb), and the exact thing it wants to
 * do (the summary, which is a command line or a path and is drawn in mono).
 *
 * The Now screen drew all three as one title and a line of `source_app · the
 * agent is stopped until you answer`, which named the project and not the
 * window — on a machine with thirty worktrees of one project that identifies
 * nothing.
