/*
 * A file's diff, flattened into the rows a list draws.
 *
 * ── why a list and not a column ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * The screen used to put every hunk of the open file inside one ScrollView,
 * which means React Native lays out and keeps mounted every row of it before
 * the first one is on screen. A four-hundred-line file is four hundred rows of
 * three text nodes each, measured up front, and the cost is paid again on
 * every repaint — a tap on a line, a thread opening, a comment being typed.
 *
 * A windowed list mounts what is near the viewport and drops the rest, which
 * it can only do if the content is a flat array of rows with stable keys. That
 * is the whole of what this file makes: the shape the renderer already draws,
 * as data instead of as nesting.
 *
 * ── it is deliberately dumb ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * No decisions live here beyond the order of things. Which lines can carry a
 * comment is `commentableLine`, where the gaps are is `gapsIn`, what changed
 * inside a line is `tokens.ts`. This only says: the gap before hunk 0, then
 * hunk 0's header, then its lines, then the gap before hunk 1 — and the tail
 * gap after the last one, which belongs to no hunk and is numbered
 * `hunks.length` for exactly that reason.

 * virtualised list expresses by drawing the same row twice and losing a
 * comment box that was open on one of them.
 *
 * A gap row is emitted only where there IS a gap, so the list has no rows that
 * draw nothing. A binary file has no hunks and gets no rows at all; the screen
 * says why in its place.
