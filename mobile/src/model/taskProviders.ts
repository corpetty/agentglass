/*
 * Whether this machine tracks work anywhere, and what that costs the bar.
 *
 * ── the question is not "is ClickUp connected" ───────────────────────────
 * ClickUp is one task provider of several. `shared/providers.ts` already lists
 * them with a `kind`, and two of them — Taskwarrior and ClickUp — are tasks
 * today, with nothing stopping a third. So the question this asks is the
 * general one: does the person on the other end of this phone track work in
 * SOMETHING. A check spelled `clickup` would be the app deciding that one
 * workspace's tool is what a task is.
 *
 * ── and the answer changes the bar, which the desk's does not ────────────
 * `web/src/lib/taskConnected.ts` answers the same question and reaches a
 * different conclusion on purpose, so the difference is worth stating rather
 * than looking like drift. Its rule is:
 *
 *   nothing set up   show every task source — this is a fresh install, and
 *                    the bar is the only advertisement the feature has
 *
 * That argument holds at a desk because an unconnected tab there LINKS to the
 * pane that connects it. It does not hold here, and the reason is a rule this
 * app spends its scope on elsewhere: a phone cannot set a provider up. There
 * is no Integrations pane on it, deliberately — the same refusal that makes
 * Troubleshooting print an install line rather than run it. So an empty Cards
 * tab on a phone advertises something you cannot act on from the device you
 * are holding, and it spends a fifth of a five-item bar doing it.
 *
 * ── a broken provider still counts ───────────────────────────────────────
 * Taken from the desk verbatim, because it is right there too: "ClickUp
 * refused this token" is not the same as "you do not use ClickUp", and hiding
 * the tab would remove the one surface that was going to say so.

/**
 * Which task provider the Cards tab reads from, and what it is called.
 *
 * The tab used to read `/clickup/views` and `/clickup/view` whoever you were,
 * and print "Open in ClickUp" on every card — a phone paired to a machine that
 * tracks work in Taskwarrior got an empty board titled after somebody else's
 * product. The rule here is the one the tab wanted all along:
 *
 *   ClickUp connected            → the board, its saved views, its cards
 *   another tracker set up       → `/tasks/list`, the provider-neutral route
 *   nothing set up               → `null`, and the tab says so
 *   no answer                    → `undefined`, and the tab waits
 *
 * ClickUp beats the rest whenever it is set up at all, `error` included — it
 * is the one with views to choose from, and a person with both wants the board
 * on the phone and the local list where the editor is. `error` still counts as
 * set up, for the reason `tracksWork` gives: a refused token is something you
 * configured, and the screen that reads it is where you find out. Ranking by
 * state FIRST used to let a connected Taskwarrior outrank a ClickUp that was
 * merely erroring (one bad notification poll) — the board a person set up
 * disappeared behind a tracker they never touched. ClickUp's identity is
 * ranked ahead of state so a set-up ClickUp never loses to another provider's
 * state; connected-vs-error only breaks a tie between two non-ClickUp
 * providers.
