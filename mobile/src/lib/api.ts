/*
 * Talking to the computer.
 *
 * The same HTTP the dashboard uses, with the device credential as a bearer
 * token — no second protocol, no RPC layer, no schema to keep in step. The
 * shapes come from `shared/types.ts`, which the server compiles against, so a
 * field that changes on one side stops type-checking on the other.
 *
 * Two things differ from `web/src/lib/api.ts`, and both come from being an app
 * rather than a page:
 *
 *   * There is no origin to infer. A page can look at `location`; this asks
 *     the paired host record, and if there is none the answer is "not paired"
 *     rather than a request to a guess.
 *   * Every failure is a value, never a throw into a render. A phone loses the
 *     network constantly — walking out of the flat is not an error condition,
 *     it is Tuesday — so `ask()` answers `{ ok: false, error }` and the screens
 *     decide what that looks like.
