/*
 * One pull request, read once, however many panes are looking at it.
 *
 * Three of them are now: the overview, the diff and the threads, and until
 * this they each fetched `/prs/detail` for themselves. That was harmless while
 * they were three screens — you were only ever on one — and stopped being
 * harmless the moment they became segments of one, because all three can be
 * mounted at the same time.
 *
 * The cost was the smaller half. The real one is that three copies of the same
 * answer disagree: resolve a thread in the Threads pane, which re-reads after
 * every write, and the Overview behind it still says "3 open" because nobody
 * told it. A number that is wrong on the screen you came from reads as the
 * write not having taken.
 *
 * So there is one copy per pull request, and a write anywhere re-reads it for
 * everybody. A module-level store rather than context, for the reason
 * card-edits.ts gives for its listeners: a pane is also a route, so the three
 * share no ancestor short of the root, and a context at the root re-renders
 * the app to change one count.
