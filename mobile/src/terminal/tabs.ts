/*
 * The tabs, shaped like the ones on the computer.
 *
 * `/terminal/panes` answers one row per PANE, and the phone drew that list
 * directly — so a window split in two appeared as two tabs with the same name,
 * and the strip did not look like the strip on the desk, which shows WINDOWS:
 *
 *     1 Orbit.AI   2 AI00   3 AI01   4 AI02   5 AI03   6 pr-8421
 *
 * So panes are grouped back into their windows here. A window with one pane is
 * one tab, named the way tmux names it — index first, because that is what the
 * prefix key addresses and what the desk shows. A window with more than one
 * becomes one tab per pane, suffixed `·p1`, `·p2`, so a split is still
 * reachable without inventing a second level of navigation on a phone.
 *
 * Pure, and separate from the screen, because "which tabs are there" is worth a
 * test and "what a tab looks like" is not.
 */

/*
 * The row is `AgentPane` from the contract, and it did not used to be.
 *
 * This file declared its own copy — eight fields plus `popup` and `attached` —
 * because the shared one described neither of the last two: they lived inline
 * in `listPanes`'s return type on the server, where nothing here could see
 * them. A private copy of a wire shape cannot be wrong about the wire, it can
 * only disagree with it silently, and `attached` is the field this strip
 * filters on. See the note on `AgentPane.attached`.

 * runs at 500ms and compares `JSON.stringify([session, client, windows])`
 * against what it last sent, and only speaks when that differs — for exactly
 * this reason, written in its own comment. The phone has no such frame, so it
 * does the comparison itself, at this end.
 *
 * Compared on the TABS rather than on the panes, and on the WHOLE tab rather
 * than on the handful of its fields that are drawn today. `/terminal/panes`
 * carries a great deal the strip is not made of — the full path, the window id,
 * the session id, one row per pane of this phone's own grouped session — and
 * `paneTabs` has already thrown all of it away, so somebody typing `cd` at the
 * desk cannot repaint anything here. Picking out only the fields that reach a
