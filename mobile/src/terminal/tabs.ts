 * The tabs, shaped like the ones on the computer.
 *
 * `/terminal/panes` answers one row per PANE, and the phone drew that list
 * directly — so a window split in two appeared as two tabs with the same name,
 * and the strip did not look like the strip on the desk, which shows WINDOWS:
 *
 *     1 Orbit.AI   2 AI00   3 AI01   4 AI02   5 AI03   6 pr-8421
 *
 * So panes are grouped back into their windows here. A window with one pane is
 * one tab, named the way tmux names it — index first, because that is what the
 * prefix key addresses and what the desk shows. A window with more than one
 * becomes one tab per pane, suffixed `·p1`, `·p2`, so a split is still
 * reachable without inventing a second level of navigation on a phone.
 *
 * Pure, and separate from the screen, because "which tabs are there" is worth a
 * test and "what a tab looks like" is not.

 * This file declared its own copy — eight fields plus `popup` and `attached` —

 * in `listPanes`'s return type on the server, where nothing here could see
