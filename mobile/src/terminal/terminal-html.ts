/*
 * The terminal, as a document.
 *
 * There is no bundler and no network inside a WebView, so the whole thing —
 * xterm, its stylesheet, the icon font and the bridge below — is built here as
 * one string and handed over as HTML. `engine.generated.ts` holds the first
 * two and `nerdfont.generated.ts` the third; this is the last.
 *
 * ── who owns the socket ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * React Native does, not this page. Two reasons, and the first is decisive:
 * the upgrade to `/terminal/pty` needs an `Origin` header, and only React
 * Native's WebSocket takes one (see live.ts). The second is that a WebView is
 * reloaded for all sorts of reasons and a socket inside it would take the
 * shell down with it.
 *
 * So bytes cross the bridge in both directions:
 *   RN → page   `AGX.write(<base64>)` / `AGX.writeMany([<base64>…])`, injected.
 *   page → RN   `postMessage` with a small JSON envelope.
 *
 * Base64 and not text: a PTY frame is raw bytes, and decoding it as UTF-8 on
 * the way through turns a multi-byte character split across two frames into two
 * replacement characters — permanently, and half the box drawing in a TUI is
 * exactly that.

 *
 * ── why the sixteen come from shared/ and not from the palette's own fields ──
 * They used to be a field-for-slot map: bg3 was black, info was blue AND cyan,
 * text was brightWhite. A palette carries four hues and a terminal needs six, so
 * that map could not be right, and measured against the two bases it was not:
 * black came out #21262d at 1.24:1 on the dark base and 1.17:1 on white —
 * invisible, in both — cyan was the same hex as blue, brightWhite the same as
 * white, and sixteen slots held ten colours. `ls --color` paints directories
 * blue and archives magenta; a diff paints its two sides red and green. Ten of
 * sixteen is a screen where some of that is silently the same colour.
 *
 * `deriveAnsi` is the desk's answer to the identical question and it branches on
 * the background's luminance, which is the part the phone had no notion of. It
 * is imported rather than reimplemented because a phone with its own idea of
 * what red means in a terminal is two products wearing one name.

   * The icons in the prompt, and only the icons.
   *
   * Android ships no Nerd Font, and asking for ui-monospace on it gets a face

   * branch, a penguin and a clock came out as a row of empty boxes. The face
   * is carried in the page rather than fetched because this document lives on
   * about:blank with no network — see the top of this file.
   *
   * It is a FALLBACK and must stay one. See FONT_STACK below: xterm measures
   * the cell from the first face that answers, so a whole Nerd Font in front
   * would re-metric every character of text on the screen to fix seven
   * symbols.
   *
   * block rather than swap, because the alternative is drawing the boxes and
   * then replacing them. There is nothing to wait for — the bytes are already
   * in the document — so the block period is a decode and not a download.
   *
   * ── why unicode-range is not decoration ───────────────────────────────────
   * Being last in the stack keeps this face away from the cell WIDTH. It does
   * not keep it away from the cell HEIGHT, and without the ranges below it took
   * it: measured in the emulator's WebView, 32 W at 8.55px came out 164.143px
   * wide either way, but the line box went 9.905px → 11.429px, and the screen
   * went from 56 rows to 47. On a phone that is nine lines of somebody's
   * output; with fit on it is also nine rows off the desk's tmux window, since
   * the server resizes the window to the geometry this page reports.
   *
   * The cause is the CSS strut: the line box comes from the FIRST AVAILABLE
   * font, and on Android ui-monospace, Menlo and Consolas are all absent — so
   * the first face that actually exists is this one, and a Nerd Font is built
   * tall. A font whose unicode-range excludes U+0020 is skipped when that is
   * decided, which is exactly what these ranges do. Measured again with them:
   * the line box is back to 9.905px and the powerline glyph still draws.
   *
   * The other candidate was ascent-override/descent-override. It also restored
   * the strut, and it did it by shrinking the icon's own box to 8.381px — a
   * powerline separator is drawn to fill the cell it sits in, so that fixes the
   * grid by mis-drawing the glyph the grid is for.
   *
   * The list is read out of the face's own cmap, not written down beside it,
   * and it is not a formality either. A range WIDER than the font is its own
   * bug: a character inside it that this face has not got and that nothing on
   * the device has either draws this face's .notdef, which in a subset is
   * empty. Measured with the ranges the subset was cut with: U+23F5 went from
   * an empty box to nothing at all. With the real coverage it is a box again.

   * A finger, turned into wheels, at the rate the PANE answers — but only when

   * the case that is not, which is the one that shipped broken.
   *
   * Reported: the terminal does not scroll with a thumb. It could not. The pane
   * is attached to tmux, which is a full-screen program — measured on the real
   * one, alternate_on=1 and history_size=0 — so xterm has no scrollback of its
   * own to drag, and there is nothing under the finger to move. The thing that
   * scrolls a screen like that is the PROGRAM, and the only way to ask it is
   * the same way a mouse does: a wheel event.
   *
   * So the drag is converted, and the encoding is deliberately left to xterm.
   * It already knows which mouse protocol the program turned on (tmux with
   * mouse on negotiates SGR), and hand-writing the escape sequence here would
   * be a second, worse copy of that knowledge that goes wrong the moment
   * something asks for a different mode.
   *
   * ── why the rate is measured and not a constant ───────────────────────────
   * This shipped at one notch per three rows, because three rows is what a
   * desktop wheel sends, and the complaint came back the same day: "el scroll
   * con el dedo es pesimo, apenas se mueve unos pixeles". Three rows is true
   * about a desktop and irrelevant here, because HOW FAR A NOTCH GOES IS NOT
   * OURS TO DECIDE. A notch is a request; the program on the other end picks
   * the distance. Measured on this machine, on the same pane, minutes apart:
   *
   *   tmux's own copy mode        5 lines a notch   (3.6a, WheelUpPane)
   *   a program with mouse on     1 line  a notch   (less --mouse — and this is
   *                                                  the case an agent's TUI is)
   *
   * Five to one, so no constant serves both. At three rows a notch, an 800px
   * drag — thirty rows of finger on this phone — moved forty lines in copy mode
   * and EIGHT in less. Both numbers come from reading the pane afterwards,
   * which is the only measurement worth anything here: the tests that let this
   * ship asserted the notches that went out and never that a screen moved.
   *
   * The ratio was not the whole of it either, and no amount of reasoning would
   * have found the other half — see the dispatch below, where four wheels out
   * of five were being swallowed inside xterm before anything left the page.
   * Both halves multiply, and eight lines for a thirty-row drag is what they
   * came to.
   *
   * So the page asks the pane. The first notch of a gesture is a probe: the
   * rows on screen are photographed, one notch goes out alone, and when the
   * repaint lands they are matched against the photograph to see HOW FAR THE
   * SCREEN ACTUALLY MOVED. That is the notch's worth in lines, and the rest of
   * the drag goes out at one notch per that many rows — so the content travels
   * with the finger whatever is in the pane, and keeps doing so when the pane
   * changes to something with different ideas.
   *
   * preventDefault, so the WebView does not also try to move the page under a

   * passive:true on the others, which never call it.

   * ── where a scroll gesture is allowed to go ───────────────────────────────

   * Three answers, and the third is the one this screen did not have.
   *
   *   'local'  the normal buffer, where xterm holds its own scrollback. A
   *            wheel scrolls the viewport and nothing leaves the page.
   *   'wheel'  a mouse protocol is live, so a wheel becomes a mouse report and
   *            the far end decides what it means. tmux with 'mouse on' takes it
   *            from here — it forwards to a program that asked for the mouse,
   *            and otherwise enters its own copy mode.
   *   'tmux'   neither. NOTHING may be dispatched, and the app is asked to move
   *            the scrollback instead.
   *
   * The third exists because of what xterm does when it is left to answer a
   * wheel on the alternate screen with no scrollback of its own: it sends a
   * CURSOR KEY, one per wheel. Measured through this exact document, in a real
   * engine, against a real pane running 'cat -v' — one 760px drag delivered 53
   * of them, a mix of ESC[B and ESC O B in the same gesture (so it is not even
   * reading DECCKM consistently), pane_in_mode stayed 0 and the screen moved one
   * line. At a shell those arrows walk history onto somebody's prompt; in an
   * agent's TUI they move the selection, and one of the things they move is an
   * Allow/Deny gate. This app exists to answer those from a phone.
   *
   * The two facts are read from xterm's public API and both were measured
   * against a real tmux before anything was written against them: with
   * 'mouse on' the page reads mouseTrackingMode "drag" and the drag delivered
   * SGR reports and ZERO keystrokes; with 'mouse off' it reads "none" and the
