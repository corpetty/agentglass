/*
 * Ctrl, Alt and Shift on a screen with nothing to hold down.
 *
 * ── why a latch and not a hold ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * A physical modifier is a key you keep pressed while you press another one.
 * A thumb cannot do that: there is one finger on the glass and it is the one
 * about to press the second key. Every terminal that has ever run on a phone
 * arrives at the same answer — the modifier is tapped, it waits, and the next
 * key press consumes it.
 *
 * ── why three states and not two ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * "Waits for one key" is the common case and it is what a single tap does.
 * It is the wrong answer for a combination pressed several times in a row,
 * and this app has one on screen: an agent's permission modes cycle on
 * Shift+Tab, so getting from one to the one after next is Shift, Tab, Shift,
 * Tab. Re-arming between every press is the kind of small tax that makes
 * somebody stop using the feature.
 *
 * So a second tap locks it until it is tapped off. The cycle is off → once →
 * locked → off, which is one control doing three things in the order a person
 * discovers them: the first tap is the thing they wanted, the second is the
 * thing they wanted after doing the first one twice.
 *
 * ── why the state is here and not in the screen ──────────────────────────
 * There is no renderer in this project. The rules — what a tap does, what
 * survives a key press, what a locked modifier does that a armed one does not
 * — are the part worth testing, and the failure mode of getting one wrong is a
 * bar that sends Ctrl+C when somebody meant to type a letter.
