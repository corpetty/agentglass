/*
 * What this phone remembers about how it draws a terminal.
 *
 * A module singleton with a subscription, which is the shape theme.ts already
 * uses and for the same reasons: the value is read by a screen's first frame,
 * it is written from a different screen, and both have to see the same thing
 * without either one owning it.
 *
 * ── the keystore, again, for something that is not a secret ──────────────
 * `expo-secure-store` is what this app has — the paired credential, the theme
 * and the seen-map all live there. A second storage library for one small
 * object would be a dependency, a build question on three platforms, and
 * another thing that can fail on a cold start. Its size limit does not bind
 * here: this is at most seventeen short ids.
 *
 * ── every failure is the default ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * A read that fails, a value from an older build, a write that is refused: all
 * of them end at the catalogue's own order with nothing hidden, which is a key
 * bar that works. The opposite failure — refusing to draw a bar because a
 * preference could not be read — is a terminal you cannot type Escape into.

/**
 * How many columns the phone asks the pane for.
 *
 * Orca calls the same setting a text size and scales the type; this app has
 * always expressed it as columns, and the two are the same dial read from
 * opposite ends — fewer columns is bigger text. Columns is the honest unit
 * here because it is what actually goes down the socket, and because the note
 * this screen already draws when a pane is wider than the phone is counted in
 * them.
 *
 * TWO rungs, and the reason is measured rather than conservative. The note over
 * `columns` in app/(tabs)/terminal.tsx has the numbers: at this phone's 412
 * CSS px, 60 columns is a 6.85px cell and 80 is 5.15px, but 120 is 3.43px —
 * above the font floor, so nothing overlaps and a screenshot merely looks like
 * small text. It is not small text. At that size the glyph is clipped inside
 * its own cell and characters change identity: `#472` read back as `#4/2` and
 * `faf0e9d` as `tat0e9d`, a seven without its bar being a slash. A width
 * control that misreports the commit somebody is looking at is worse than one
 * that does not offer the rung, and 100 is not offered either because nobody
 * has measured it.
 *
 * Stored because it is a property of the PHONE — its screen, and whose eyes
 * are on it — rather than of any pane, so re-choosing it on every attach was
 * work nobody should have to repeat.

 * Whether the phone's keyboard may help while composing a line.

 * and branch names into English words, and it does it silently — `--no-verify`
 * becomes `--no verify`, `src/ui.tsx` gains a capital, and the first anybody
 * knows is a command that did not run or, worse, one that ran differently.
 *
 * It is offered at all because the same field is also where somebody types a
 * sentence to an agent, and there the help is help. So it is a choice, made
 * once, defaulting to the side where being wrong is cheap.
 *
 * Direct keys are unaffected either way: in `keys` mode a keystroke goes to
 * the pane without passing through a composer, so there is nothing for a
 * suggestion to act on.
