 * A live terminal on the phone: the WebView, the socket, and the wire between.
 *
 * The socket lives here rather than in the page, because the upgrade to
 * `/terminal/pty` needs an `Origin` header and only React Native's WebSocket
 * takes one (live.ts explains why the server insists). It also means a WebView
 * reload — which happens for reasons of its own — does not take the shell with
 * it.
 *
 * The protocol is the dashboard's, unchanged, and now written down in one
 * place instead of three — `PtyServerFrame` and `PtyClientFrame` in
 * shared/types.ts. Binary frames are raw PTY bytes and are the one thing that
 * cannot be in a contract: they have no envelope, which is the point of them.
 *
 * Bytes reach the page base64-encoded, because decoding a PTY frame as UTF-8
 * on the way through breaks any multi-byte character that lands across a frame
 * boundary — permanently, and in a TUI that is most of the box drawing.
