/*
 * Opening the keyboard for a field nobody can see.
 *
 * ── what this is for ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * In `keys` mode the composer is not a field. It is a button that reports the
 * line and, when pressed, hands the keyboard to a 1×1 transparent TextInput
 * sitting behind it — every keystroke goes to the pane as bytes and nothing on
 * screen grows. Orca's mobile client is built the same way and calls it live
 * input; the two problems below are the ones that arrangement creates, and
 * both of them fail silently, which is why they are here with tests rather
 * than inline with a comment.
 *
 * ── one: the WebView has not let go yet ──────────────────────────────────
 * The tap that should open the keyboard lands on the terminal, which is a
 * WebView, and the WebView still owns the keyboard at the moment it tells us
 * the touch ended. Focusing inside that notification is a no-op — the tap does
 * nothing at all, which reads as the app being broken rather than as a race.
 * So a focus is scheduled rather than performed, and a pending one is replaced
 * rather than queued: two quick taps during a route change would otherwise
 * focus a field that has since been unmounted.
 *
 * ── two: Android keeps a hidden field focused after the IME is gone ───────
 * Dismiss the keyboard with the back gesture and the field is still, as far as
 * it is concerned, focused. `focus()` on an already-focused field does
 * nothing, so the keyboard never comes back and the only way out is to leave
 * the screen. The fix is to notice the disagreement — the keyboard is down and
 * the field says it is focused — and force a new focus session by blurring
 * first. That is the whole reason this takes `keyboardShown`: it is not
 * decoration, it is the only evidence that the two disagree.

 * dropped on it, whichever route the key took — the bar's ⏎, the keyboard's
 * return, or an IME that commits the newline as text.
 *
 * CR and LF both, because the bar sends CR and a pasted line arrives as LF.
