   * while tmux's pane_in_mode stayed 0 and the screen moved a single line.
   *
   * Those arrows are not cosmetic. At a shell they walk history onto the
   * prompt and one stray Enter runs it; in an agent's TUI they move the
   * selection, including on an Allow/Deny gate — which is the thing this app
   * exists to answer from a phone.
   *
   * `?1049h` is the alternate screen, which is the state a tmux attach puts

 * background. agentglass syncs the desk's theme into the user's tmux and that
 * conf carries `window-style "bg=<the desk's background>"`; measured against a
 * real tmux with a real client on a pty, every cell then arrives carrying
 * ESC[48;2;30;30;30m, for xterm-256color, tmux-256color and xterm-direct alike.
 * A phone in Light against that painted #1f2328 text on #1e1e1e and the words at
 * the top of a session disappeared, which is why the pane was pinned to dark and
 * stopped following the phone at all.
 *
 * So the page reads the background out of its own buffer and wears the set that
 * is legible on it. Nothing here asks the page what it thinks: the foreground is
 * read back off the DOM with getComputedStyle, because what a row is painted
 * with is the only thing a reader actually gets.
