/*
 * Whether this machine tracks work anywhere, and what the bar does about it.
 *
 * The question this app was getting wrong is not "is ClickUp connected". It is
 * the general one — ClickUp is one task provider of several, and a phone that
 * offers a Cards row to somebody who tracks work in Taskwarrior, or in nothing
 * at all, is showing them somebody else's product.
 *
 * Two failures are guarded here and they fail in opposite directions. Showing
 * the row when there is no board costs a tap to learn nothing. HIDING it on an
 * answer that never arrived costs the row itself, and there is no way to get it
 * back from the phone: providers are connected at the computer.
