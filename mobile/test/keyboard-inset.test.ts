/*
 * Nobody may hand KeyboardAvoidingView a behaviour that is nothing on Android.
 *
 * This is the bug that hid the chat input behind the keyboard on his own
 * phone. Two screens carried
 *
 *   behavior={Platform.OS === "ios" ? "padding" : undefined}
 *
 * which on Android means the view does not avoid the keyboard at all. It read
 * as harmless for as long as the system resized the window under
 * `adjustResize` — the window shrank, the input came with it, and the prop
 * never had to work. That stopped: Expo Go targets SDK 36, and from Android 15
 * a window that opted into edge-to-edge (app.json, `edgeToEdgeEnabled`) is not
 * resized for the IME. The prop was suddenly the only thing holding the input
 * up, and it was `undefined`.
 *
 * MEASURED on two emulators, same Expo Go 57.0.3, same bundle: on API 34 the
 * chat input rose above the keyboard, on API 36 it was drawn behind it. So the
 * ONE test a source file can carry is this: `padding`, on both platforms, with
 * the offset spelt out. The arithmetic that makes one expression right on both
 * — `frame.y + frame.height - keyboardTop`, which comes out zero when the
 * window already shrank and equals the overlap when it did not — is written
 * out in app/(tabs)/terminal.tsx, the screen that had it right first.
 *
 * A screenshot proves it for the screens that existed on the day. This proves
 * it for the next one somebody writes.
