/*
 * A window this screen opened is followed to its OWN session.
 *
 * Left unset, `open` stayed null forever whenever the new window landed
 * somewhere other than whichever session was already on screen — a phone's
 * mirror is grouped with a desk session that does not share the repo's name,
 * and the server's own fallback for an unattached press is the repo's
 * basename regardless. The strip's filter is `t.session === session`
 * (terminal.tsx), so the pane existed on the machine and the phone still
 * showed "Nothing open" over it.
