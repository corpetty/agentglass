/*
 * What a failed request is allowed to put on a phone's screen.
 *
 * Found in QA, not in review, and worth the file: with the sidecar down the
 * Home screen's Plan card rendered
 *
 *   fetch failed: java.net.ConnectException: Failed to connect to /127.0.0.1:4000
 *
 * verbatim, twice — once in the card and once in the status line above it. Two
 * things wrong with that and only one of them is about tidiness.
 *
 * The other is that the address in a connection error is the USER'S OWN
 * NETWORK. A phone pairs over the LAN or a tailnet, so a screenshot of a
 * disconnected Home screen publishes where the machine lives. Nothing that
 * reaches a caller may carry one.
 *
 * `Network request failed` — React Native's own wording — was the only shape
 * handled. Hermes on Android hands the JVM exception through instead, and there
 * are several of those.
