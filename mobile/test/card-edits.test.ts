/*
 * A card moved on its own screen reaches the list behind it.
 *
 * Before: the card screen re-read the card and the Cards tab kept the row it
 * had, so going back showed the old column until a pull-to-refresh. The move
 * had landed on the board and the phone said it had not.
 *
 * Two halves. The pure one — `withCard` — is checked for what it changes and,
 * as carefully, for what it leaves alone: a list re-rendered for a card it does
 * not hold is a FlatList flicker on every edit anywhere in the app. The bus is
 * checked for delivering to the live listeners and no longer to a dead one.
 * The card screen's half — that it SENDS the stamp and ANNOUNCES the answer —
 * is read from the source in card-move.test.ts, the way the hand-off is.
