 * arrives beside the one you work in. On a desk that is a row to scroll past;

 *

 * the real `/terminal/panes`:
 *
 *     canAttach: true   panes: 2
 *       agx-probe-9f2  win 0 sh      pane %0  attached true   <- a test's

 * `agentglass-understudy`, so a prefix test would have been a guess wearing a
