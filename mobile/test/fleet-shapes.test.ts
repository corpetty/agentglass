/*
 * The shapes the queue is built from, against a real server.
 *
 * This exists because of a bug that a type-check and a bundle both passed and
 * a phone did not: the app asked `/sessions` for `{ sessions: [...] }` and the
 * server answers the array itself. `buildQueue` then reached a `for…of` over
 * `undefined` and threw "Cannot convert undefined value to object", which is
 * not a missing card — it is a render error that takes the whole app down.
 *
 * The lesson is narrow and worth encoding: a TypeScript annotation on a
 * `fetch` is a claim about the server, checked by nobody. So this boots the
 * real one and reads the three routes the Now screen depended on. An empty
 * machine is enough — the mistake was about the WRAPPER, and `[]` and
 * `{sessions: []}` differ just as clearly when there is nothing in them.
 *
 * Now and its `buildQueue` are gone, and the phone reads only the gates of the
 * three today. The other two stay here because the shapes are the server's,
 * and the next screen to read `/sessions` is the one that will assume the
 * wrapper again.
