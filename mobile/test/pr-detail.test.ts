/*
 * One pull request, read once, however many panes are looking at it.
 *
 * Three of them are, since the review became one screen with three segments —
 * the overview, the diff and the threads. Two things had to become true for
 * that not to be a regression:
 *
 *   they make ONE request between them, not three;
 *   and a write in any of them re-reads for all three, so the count on the
 *   overview cannot still say "3 open" after you resolved one next door.
 *
 * `fetch` is stubbed rather than a server booted: the question is what this
 * store does with an answer, not what the server answers.
