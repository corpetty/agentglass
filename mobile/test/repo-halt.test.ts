/*
 * A repository git stopped halfway through, and the phone's total silence
 * about it.
 *
 * `treeState()` has probed `.git` for this since the beginning — it is how git
 * itself decides, and it is one stat per state. The phone's `loadTrees` copied
 * `branch.name`, `ahead` and `behind` off the tree and dropped `branch.state`,
 * so a checkout sitting on a half-finished rebase rendered exactly like a clean
 * one: a branch name, a dirty count, no banner, no way out. That is the single
 * situation the companion exists for — you walked away and something needs a
 * person — and it was the one it could not show.
