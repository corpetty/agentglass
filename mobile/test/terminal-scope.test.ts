/*
 * The terminal opens a pane only for a phone that may type.
 *
 * `/terminal/pty` needs `full` (server/src/auth.ts, FULL_GET). The Inbox
 * listed the Terminal for every pairing and the screen opened the socket for
 * every pairing, so a phone paired for `read` was walked into a pane whose
 * socket the server closed on arrival, and told the connection had been lost.
 *
 * The destination is in the bar for every pairing now, because the Terminal
 * screen is also where an `answer` phone answers held gates. So the claim moved
 * from "the list cuts it" to "the screen decides before the pane mounts": the
 * rule (`canRunAgents`) is run, and the screens are READ, the way
 * handoff-carries-an-id.test.ts reads them.
