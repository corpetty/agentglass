 *   font and Medium is an instance of it, so a static-metrics reading is

  //
  //   DejaVu Sans (the one real face present) was parsed for its `hmtx`
  //   advances and each of the five measured words laid out in it. The
  //   Roboto/DejaVu ratio came out between 0.8824 ("Review") and 0.9127
  //   ("Repos") — a 3% spread over five words, which is what makes the
