/*
 * One engine's config must not be written over another's.
 *
 * The generated tmux.conf is a materialisation of config.json — which lives
 * under XDG_CONFIG_HOME — but it was written to the STATE dir, which follows
 * XDG_STATE_HOME. Redirect one and not the other, as every harness in this repo
 * did, and a throwaway instance rewrites the conf the real engine runs on.
 * Nothing warns: the file is ours, so `ensureConf` just writes it.
 *
 * Measured on a real machine, twice in one afternoon. A probe with an isolated
 * config (and therefore no prefix set) rewrote the shared `tmux.conf` with
 * `set -g prefix C-b`, and the desk's engine — up since 08:42 and never
 * restarted — came back reporting C-b, because the settings panel's Save and
 * the prefix heal both `source-file` that path into the live server. Reported
 * as "tmux has changed by itself again… settings show ctrl + f and the console
 * shows ctrl + b".
 *
 * The default install keeps the plain name — an installed app must not orphan
 * the file its running server was started with.
