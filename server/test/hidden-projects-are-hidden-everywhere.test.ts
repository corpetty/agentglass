/*
 * A project removed from the list stays removed in the panels.
 *
 * Hiding only ever reached the project picker. The three projects taken off
 * "Open a project" were still grouped in the unscoped Diff view, still in the
 * checkout dropdown of pull requests, and still in every other list that asks
 * discoverRepos who is on this machine — a remove button that removed the row
 * it was on and nothing else.
 *
 * Both halves are asserted, because the fix is only correct with both: the
 * panels' list (`{}`) leaves them out, and the picker's (`ignoreScope`) still
 * has them, since it is the one surface that can put one back.
 *
 * Settings go in a scratch XDG_CONFIG_HOME, which is also what the config
 * writer enforces on itself under test.
