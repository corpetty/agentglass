/*
 * The two routes behind "keep this one" and "what is running".
 *
 * Driven against a real server, because the interesting half is not the pane
 * bookkeeping (that has its own suite) but what the HTTP does with it: which
 * names are refused before they can reach `tmux kill-session -t`, and how the
 * orphan judgement is put together from two things neither side knows alone.
 *
 * Most of it runs against an empty socket, which is exactly the state of a
 * machine with the pane engine switched off — worth pinning that the panel
 * answers rather than errors there, since the alternative is a settings tab
 * that fails to load for everybody not using panes.
 *
 * The orphan judgement gets a real tmux session, because it is the one thing
 * that cannot be observed without a pane to judge. Skipped where tmux is not
 * installed, and on its own socket with a `sleep` in it — never a `claude`.
