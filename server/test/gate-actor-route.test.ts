/*
 * "I approved that from my phone", end to end — #299.
 *
 * Everything below goes through a real server with a real paired device rather
 * than through the functions directly, because the part that was missing is
 * plumbing: the route has to know which caller presented which credential, and
 * hand the same answer to the gate row and to the action log. A unit test of
 * `actorOf` passes just as happily when the route never calls it.
 *
 * The gate that nobody decides is here for the same reason. It is the outcome
 * with no request behind it, so it is the one an audit trail loses first.
