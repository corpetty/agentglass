/*
 * Most sessions have no name.
 *
 * `custom_title` is a rename by hand and `ai_title` is one the agent generated,

 * that never got one shows its own uuid forever — which on a real machine is
 * most of them, and a phone list of thirty rows reading `agentglass:cd3fa401`
 * cannot be scanned by eye at all.
 *
 * The first thing you typed has been in the database the whole time: every
 * prompt is ingested as a `UserPromptSubmit` event. So the rollup carries it,
 * which also means sessions recorded long before this existed get named.
