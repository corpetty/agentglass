/*
 * "Take me to that agent" must land on the desk, never on the phone.
 *
 * `focusPaneAnywhere` is what the bar's "needs you" chip runs: given a pane id,
 * find the tmux server holding it and switch the client onto it. A grouped
 * phone-mirror session (`agx-phone-<digits>-<suffix>`) shares the desk's window,
 * so `list-panes -a` reports the SAME pane twice — once under the real session
 * and once under the mirror. Two behaviours in that one function keep the desk
 * off the phone-sized doubled view, and both are load-bearing:
 *
 *   (a) the mirror row is filtered out — `!PHONE_SESSION.test(r.session)` — so a
 *       pane that appears under both sessions is matched on the REAL one, and
 *   (b) the switch uses the matched row's OWN session/window ids, not the ids
 *       the click carried (which, coming from the same duplicated list, may be
 *       the mirror's).
 *
 * A regression that reverts either silently `switch-client`s the desk onto the
 * phone-sized mirror it cannot close without reloading tmux. Neither had a test.
 *
 * Everything here runs against a real tmux server on its own socket with
 * `-f /dev/null`, because this is a question about how `focusPaneAnywhere`
 * drives tmux through a grouped session and a mock of tmux could only confirm
 * what was already believed. The socket lives inside a private
 * `$TMUX_TMPDIR/tmux-<uid>` directory rather than /tmp/tmux-<uid>, so discovery
 * (`tmuxSockets` reads TMUX_TMPDIR) finds THIS server and never the developer's
 * — the same isolation the `-f /dev/null`, own-socket rule buys the window-size
 * suite. `$TMUX` is cleared for the run so a bare-socket resolution cannot fall
 * back to the server this process is itself sitting inside.
