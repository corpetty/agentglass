/*
 * THE INVARIANT: a tmux session cannot be lost by anything this app does.
 *
 * On 2026-08-25 the machine rebooted and Electron crash-looped — six launches
 * in twenty-three minutes, one a hard `Failed to shutdown`. Every tmux session
 * from the previous day was gone afterwards except one. The tmux daemon never
 * died: it is a separate process and it survived all six.
 *
 * What died was the bookkeeping. `captureLayout()` photographed whichever
 * sessions were alive at that instant and OVERWROTE layout.json with that set.
 * Mid-crash-loop, that set was tiny. The next boot read the smaller file, saw
 * those sessions already existed, restored nothing further, and photographed
 * the small set again. State could only shrink.
 *
 * These tests are the invariant, not the implementation: whatever the means,
 * a capture must never end with fewer sessions recorded than it started with,
 * unless somebody explicitly closed one.
 *
 * Against the machine's real tmux, on our own socket and our own state dir.
