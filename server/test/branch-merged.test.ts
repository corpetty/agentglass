// The branches panel gates its delete on that answer: get it wrong and a branch
// whose PR landed weeks ago still refuses to delete, with a "not fully merged"
// error the user can only clear from a terminal. Ancestry alone always gets it
// wrong for the two shapes GitHub's merge button actually produces — squash
// replays the work as one brand new commit, rebase replays it as several, and
// in neither case does the branch tip become an ancestor of anything.
//
// So this pins the three merge shapes separately, plus the two cases where the
// answer must stay "no" — an open branch, and one sharing no history at all —
// plus the two ways a correct answer can still be lost afterwards: an expiring
// cache, and a branch that grows new commits once the verdict is already in.
