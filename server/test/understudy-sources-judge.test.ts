/*
 * Which sources are somebody else's, and which we dare suggest.
 *
 * This file exists because the first version of that judgement shipped, was
 * pressed, and ticked 646 files and 400 MB of an employer's transcripts while
 * labelling them "yours" and "suggested".
 *
 * The cause was one regex against the wrong string: it tested for the project
 * name OR the username in the FULL PATH, and every path on a machine contains
 * that machine's username. So the username matched everything and every source
 * was classified as the user's own work.
 *
 * Two rules come out of that and both are asserted below:
 *
 *   The username must never make a source look open. A Claude project
 *   directory encodes the home path in its own NAME — `-home-<user>-code-<x>`
 *   — so stripping the home prefix from the path is not enough; it has to come
 *   off the directory name too.
 *
 *   Nothing sensitive is ever suggested, whatever kind it is. Rules recorded
 *   while working on an employer's project are the user's own writing and are
 *   still about that project. One click ticks them by hand; being asked is the
 *   entire point of the screen.

   * THIS ASSERTION USED TO SAY THE OPPOSITE, and the change is deliberate.

   * The first version refused to suggest anything marked sensitive, on the
   * reasoning that an employer's project is "somebody else's work". That
   * reasoning was wrong on the facts. It is one person's machine, the work
   * project is their own work, and it is the densest record of how they
   * actually operate — refusing to learn from it is refusing to learn from most
   * of what they do.
   *
   * `sensitive` never meant "not yours". It means "filed in the CLOSED
   * partition rather than the open one", and the partition is the safety
   * property, not the tick box. A closed precedent is banked closed and
   * `retrieve()` takes a partition as a required argument — so it cannot come
   * back for open work whether or not anybody ticked it.
   *
   * What survives from the incident is the part that was actually about safety:
   * a scratch directory is still never suggested, and the classifier still must
   * not be fooled by the username.
