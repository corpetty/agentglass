/*
 * A PANE ID IS ONE SERVER'S, AND A REBOOT HANDS THE SAME IDS OUT AGAIN.
 *
 * The note that says which conversation is in which pane was keyed by the
 * pane id alone. Two tmux servers on one machine — the engine the app runs,
 * and the person's own — both have a `%0`, both fire the hooks, and whichever
 * fired last owned the row. The restore already refused a note from another
 * server, so the engine's agent was photographed with the conversation its
 * argv happened to carry, or none:
 *
 *   - a Claude started fresh after a reboot has no `--resume` on its line, so
 *     it was photographed with nothing and came back from the next boot as a
 *     shell — its conversation orphaned;
 *   - a restored Claude that has since `/clear`ed carries the OLD id on its
 *     line, so it was photographed with that and the next boot resumed the
 *     conversation it had left.
 *
 * Driven here on two real servers on private sockets, with a stand-in for the
 * CLI (a shell loop given `claude` as its argv[0], which is what the process
 * walk sees), through a simulated reboot: the engine is killed and started
 * again, and the restored panes come back on the same ids.
