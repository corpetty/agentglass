/**
 * THE SUITE MUST NOT WRITE THE SETTINGS OF WHOEVER RUNS IT.
 *
 * Measured this morning, with the deputy stuck and its screen reading "it has
 * nowhere to work": the fence held `agentglass`, one test file ran from the
 * repository root, and the fence held `""`. The suite had been emptying the
 * owner's own setting a dozen times a night. Everything else about the deputy
 * being stuck was downstream of that.
 *
 * Two faults, and each one alone was enough:
 *
 *   `server/bunfig.toml` carries the preload that redirects XDG_CONFIG_HOME,
 *   and bun reads a bunfig from the directory it was STARTED in — so
 *   `cd server && bun test` was protected and `bun test server/` from the root,
 *   which is how everything in this repo actually runs it, was not.
 *
 *   The redirect was `if (!XDG_CONFIG_HOME)`, so a machine that sets it — at
 *   the real `~/.config`, which is the whole point — got no protection at all.
 *
 * This asserts the property rather than either mechanism: wherever the settings
 * of this process live, it is not where a person's do.
