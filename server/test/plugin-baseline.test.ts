/*
 * The baseline scan reads a stranger's repository in CI and quotes what it
 * finds into a public comment. Both halves of that sentence are a way to be
 * robbed, and both are tested here with a repository built to do it:
 *
 *   - a symlink named like a source file, pointing at a file outside the
 *     folder. `os.walk` skips symlinked DIRECTORIES and not symlinked FILES,
 *     so this is the one that reads a runner's environment and prints it;
 *   - a line crafted to close the fence it is quoted inside and forge the
 *     marker comment the workflow writes at the end of its own report.
