/*
 * What the understudy throws away, and the one thing it must throw away even
 * when the user has switched retention off.
 *
 * Two windows, and they are not the same window on purpose. A sealed situation
 * is the evidence behind one disagreement — useful while somebody might still
 * open it, worthless a month later — so it dies at thirty days. The bare fact
 * that a write happened is a stub, and it dies at ninety. What never dies is a
 * scored decision or a fence: those are the score itself, and a score with
 * holes in it is not a score, it is a number that flatters whichever period
 * survived.
 *
 * The last test is the reason both sweeps sit ABOVE the `if (!RETENTION_DAYS)
 * return` in pruneOldRows. AGENTGLASS_RETENTION_DAYS is the user's to set and 0
 * is a legitimate value meaning "keep the events". If the understudy's expiry
 * hung off that switch, somebody turning event pruning off would silently stop
 * the sealed situations expiring too — a store holding the material the
 * understudy read, growing without bound, because of a setting about something
 * else entirely. It runs in its own process because RETENTION_DAYS is read once
 * at module load, which is exactly how the real server reads it.
