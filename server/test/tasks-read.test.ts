/*

 * and pointing it at somebody's real store is how a test suite ends up owning
 * their afternoon. The fixture is built here rather than committed, so the
 * assertions describe the shape rather than a snapshot.
 *
 * Deliberately covers what a real store usually does not: a task due TODAY —
 * where the UTC→local conversion earns its keep, because getting it wrong makes
 * every such task render permanently overdue — a deleted one, a project, two
 * annotations of different kinds, and a description carrying the characters the
 * quick-add grammar treats as tokens.

 * is stored as 22:00Z of the *previous* day, which a UTC parent then reads back
 * as yesterday. Both are right in their own zone; the test is what was wrong.
 * Production never sees this — the server and the `task` it spawns are one
