/*
 * Who may read the build's identity, and how much of it.
 *
 * `/update/status` was gated to the packaged shell's custom scheme, reads and
 * all. The reason was sound — the full answer names the clone on disk, names
 * the remote it pulls from, and carries the tail of the last update log, none
 * of which a phone on the wifi has any business seeing. The cost was not
 * noticed: the About pane is the only place the version is written down, and it
 * asks this endpoint for it. From `bun run dev`, from single-port mode, from a
 * paired phone — every browser there is — the request came back 403 and the
 * pane sat on "Reading version…" forever. An About tab that cannot say what
 * version you are running is the one thing an About tab is for.
 *
 * So the gate redacts rather than refuses: identity for anyone the outer origin
 * gate already let in, provenance and the update button for the desktop shell
 * alone. These tests pin both halves, because widening this by accident is how
 * the install path ends up on a phone screen.
