/*
 * The party being held cannot let itself go.
 *
 * The gate is a PreToolUse hook: an agent asks to be stopped, and stays stopped
 * until somebody answers. Everything it is worth rests on the second half, and
 * the second half was not true. The hook that raises the hold runs as this user,
 * so it reads `~/.config/agentglass/token` or finds `AGENTGLASS_TOKEN` in its own
 * environment; `/gate/decide` was behind `trustedCaller`, which admits a caller
 * with no Origin on loopback because that is exactly what a hook is. One `curl`
 * from the agent's own shell released the agent's own call, `actorOf` wrote
 * `local` into the audit row — the same string the desk's button writes — and
 * gate.ts told the model a human had reviewed it.
 *
 * So these run against a real spawned server and are shaped like the attack
 * rather than like a description of it: the request that must fail is a POST
 * carrying the machine token and no Origin header, which is what
 * `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENTGLASS_TOKEN"` produces and nothing else
 * does. The three that must keep working are the three ways a person actually
 * answers — the packaged shell, a browser on this machine, a paired phone — and
 * they are here because breaking any of them makes the feature worse than the
 * bug did.
 *
 * What this does NOT prove, and no test in this file can: that a determined
 * local process is stopped. `Origin` is a string, and a client that sets it on
 * purpose passes — the last two tests below are, mechanically, that forgery
 * wearing a browser's clothes. The bar this raises is from "the curl you would
 * write anyway" to "a curl written to defeat the gate". See the comment on
 * `mayReleaseAHold` in index.ts, and the scope paragraph in SECURITY.md.
