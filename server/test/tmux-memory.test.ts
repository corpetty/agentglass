/*
 * Reopening the session you left, without going outside the app to attach.
 *
 * The complaint, exactly: close agentglass, open it again, and the tmux session
 * you were working in is not on offer — `tmux attach -t <name>` in some other
 * terminal is what brings it back. After every rebuild.
 *
 * Two losses cause it and both are ours. The panel's client is usually the only
 * client on that server, so closing the app detaches the session; `listPanes`
 * skips servers with no client at all. And the socket was only ever held in a
 * module variable, so the next run did not know which server was yours.
 *
 * Real tmux on sockets of this file's own, because the claim is about what tmux
 * reports for a detached server, and a mock would only confirm what I already
 * believed. `-f /dev/null` on every one of them: nothing here may read the
 * user's configuration, and nothing here may touch their tmux.
