/**
 * Showing another tmux session in the strip — because a person asked, never
 * because the app decided.
 *
 * The strip shows the windows of the session its own client is attached to, so
 * a window opened anywhere else is invisible: "that tab doesn't show up in the terminal".
 * The app's first answer was to switch the client itself, and that took four
 * windows of somebody's own work off their screen at once — "I've completely
 * lost my tmux that had my work sessions in it". A person choosing is
 * the opposite act: they know where they are going, and the way back is one
 * more choice.
 *
 * Driven against a REAL tmux on a socket of its own, with `-f /dev/null` — on
 * this machine a named socket still reads ~/.tmux.conf, and continuum would
 * start restoring the developer's own sessions inside the test.
