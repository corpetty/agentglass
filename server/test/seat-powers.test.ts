/*
 * WHAT THE SEAT MAY DO IS A CREDENTIAL, NOT A SENTENCE.
 *
 * The seat's prompt tells it what it may do, and a prompt is a wish. These are
 * the tests for the wall: a chair set to `speak` holds a token that cannot
 * prompt an agent, and one set to `nudge` holds one that cannot start or stop
 * one, whatever either of them has been told.
 *
 * The failure this guards against is specific and has happened in this
 * repository before, to the clone: an agent the server starts inherits the
 * environment, the machine token is in it, and the thing being fenced ends up
 * holding the key to the fence.
