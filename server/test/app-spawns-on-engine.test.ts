/*
 * Everything the APP starts, starts on the engine.
 *
 * Three buttons — review a pull request, work an issue, the phone's `+` — used
 * to open a window in whatever tmux the panel's shell happened to be running:
 * the user's own server, with the user's own config. Three things were wrong
 * with that, and the third is the one that had already cost real work:
 *
 *   - It only worked if you had typed `tmux` in that pane. Without a client to
 *     resolve out of /proc the buttons answered "this terminal has no tmux",
 *     so a feature's availability depended on something you did in a shell.
 *   - It put the app's windows among yours, where a `kill-window` or a
 *     `resize-window` meant for one of ours could reach one of yours. Pane and
 *     window ids are per-SERVER, and that ambiguity has shrunk a real session.
 *   - The engine already survives the app closing, which is what the user's
 *     tmux was being borrowed FOR.
 *
 * These are source checks rather than behaviour: what is being locked is WHICH
 * SOCKET a call lands on, and a test that opens a real window would prove the
 * window opened without proving where.
