/*
 * The suite takes its scratch directories with it when it goes.
 *
 * Nearly every file here opens a `mkdtempSync(join(tmpdir(), "agx-…"))` — 383
 * calls across 182 files — and almost none of them remove it. One run leaks a
 * few hundred directories; a week of runs leaks tens of thousands. Measured on
 * the machine this was written for: **14,096 stale `agx-*` directories in /tmp,
 * 8.5 GB**, and `/tmp` there is a tmpfs, so all of it was RAM that had been
 * pushed into swap. The desktop raised an out-of-memory warning with 1.9 GiB of
 * swap left; sweeping brought it back to 11.6 GiB.
 *
 * One preload rather than 182 `afterAll`s. Cleanup written at the call site is
 * cleanup somebody forgets on the 183rd file, and a test that fails half way
 * through never reaches its own `afterAll` anyway — which is exactly the run
 * that leaves the biggest mess.
 *
 * Two rules keep this from ever deleting something it should not:
 *
 *   - it removes only paths THIS PROCESS created, recorded as they are handed
 *     out. Sweeping by name pattern would have been simpler and wrong: several
 *     agents run this suite at once on this machine, and a pattern sweep would
 *     delete another run's directories out from under it, mid-test.
 *   - it removes only paths under `os.tmpdir()`. A test that deliberately makes
 *     a directory somewhere else is none of this file's business.
 *
 * `node:fs` is patched through `createRequire`, not through the ESM namespace:
 * the ESM namespace object is frozen (`Attempted to assign to readonly
 * property`), while the CommonJS module object behind it is the same object the
 * named imports resolve against — verified, not assumed.
