/**
 * A window a person asked for opens in the session they are looking at.
 *
 * Said four times before it was written down, and the last time as plainly as
 * it can be said: "when I click resolve a conflict, or when I click any button
 * that says hand to the terminal, it has to open in the session I have open,
 * it must not create a new session".
 *
 * `engineWindowRunning` derived the session from the WORKTREE — one tmux
 * session per checkout — so a conflict in another checkout opened a window in
 * a session that was never on screen. The strip only shows the session its own
 * client is attached to, so the window was invisible; and the fix that switches
 * the client onto it took four windows of somebody's own work off their screen
 * instead. There was never a technical reason for the split: a window lives in
 * one session and starts its shell wherever `-c` says.
 *
 * ONE EXCEPTION, and it is deliberate: the clone's own runs. Those it starts by
 * itself, and they belong in a session of their own rather than filling
 * somebody's strip with windows they did not open.
