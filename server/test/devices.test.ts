/*
 * A credential per device, and what that buys over one password for the machine.
 *
 * Three of these are the reasons the file exists: a stored credential is not a
 * working key, cutting one device off leaves the others alone, and a phone gets
 * what it was granted rather than everything. The fourth is the boring one that
 * makes the rest true — a lookup that does not leak how much of a guess was
 * right.
