// Scope as a boundary, not just a filter.
//
// #48 made an open project narrow what you can *see*. This pins the other half:
// what you can *touch*. A cockpit that shows one project while still handing out
// git writes and a login shell anywhere on the machine is the confusing
// half-state — the UI claims one project and the capabilities say otherwise.
//
// The rule is deliberately shared by every write path (git mutations, the PTY,
// chat) rather than re-implemented per call site, because the original scoping
// bug was exactly that: each endpoint had to remember, and most didn't.
