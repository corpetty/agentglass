// fixWorktreeOwnership hands a path to `pkexec chown -R`, so the gate that
// decides "this is really a worktree of this repo" is the only thing standing
// between a local user and chowning an arbitrary root-owned directory to
// themselves. A prunable entry — a broken registration whose gitdir points
// nowhere valid — can be fabricated by anyone with write access to the repo to
// name any path, so it must not count as a real worktree here.
