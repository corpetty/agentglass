// notes reports `status --porcelain` completely empty, so anything that asks
// git "is it clean?" and acts on a yes has already lost that work.
//
// These pin the difference: the ignored file that git hides, the noise that
// would bury it, and the two answers that must never read as "nothing to lose"
// — a path that isn't ours, and a checkout we couldn't read at all.
