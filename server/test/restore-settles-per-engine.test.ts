/*
 * THE DESK IS WHOLE ON ONE ENGINE, AND A NEW ENGINE IS PUT BACK.
 *
 * A session or window missing from a photograph is forgotten only once this
 * process has put the desk back on the tmux server it is looking at. Bound to
 * the server read once at the end of the first pass, that went wrong two
 * ways, both measured: with no server running at that moment (a first run, or
 * a layout that had just been cleared) the desk was never whole for the life
 * of the process; and after the server was replaced — the last session
 * closed, the conf reset, a crash — it was never whole again. Either way a
 * tab somebody closed was kept, and rebuilt at the next boot.
 *
 * Real tmux on its own socket and its own state directory.
