/*
 * How the restore asks the machine about processes, on a Mac and on Linux.
 *
 * The Linux spelling is measured and exact: `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` for an argv
 * (NUL-separated, so a value with a space survives), the kernel's own
 * children list where it exists and `ps -o pid= --ppid` where it does not.
 * The Mac one exists because the Linux one is not merely different there, it
 * is absent — `ps --ppid` is GNU, there is no /proc — so every pane restored
 * as a plain shell on a Mac until the seam was stated. The suite runs on
 * Linux and states a Mac through `ProcReader`.
 *
 * What the walk is for: the agent under a pane, with its argv — the pane's
 * own process first, because a window born from `exec claude …` has no shell
 * left in it and the agent IS that process.
