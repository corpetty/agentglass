/*
 * A mark that is still being taken is not a mark that was abandoned.
 *
 * `sweepPinnedWindows` acts on `@agx-had-size` and justifies it with "stale by
 * definition": at boot, no phone in THIS process has attached to anything, so
 * every mark it can see belongs to a run that is gone. That is true of every
 * instant except one. `windowSizeOptions` writes the mark BEFORE its caller
 * spawns the attach argv, and the phone's `agx-phone-…` session — the only
 * thing `phoneWindows()` can see — does not exist until that spawn lands. For
 * the length of one spawn the window is marked and unprotected.
 *
 * MEASURED on a private server with the argv held back, before the fix:
 *
 *   after attachArgvFor    mark=none   sessions=desk   phoneWindows=[]
 *   a second server boots  restored=0
 *   after that sweep       mark=(gone)
 *
 * `restored=0`: nothing moved, nothing looked wrong, no test went red. But the
 * durable record was gone, and the fit a millisecond later pinned that window
 * with nothing on it to say who by — so a SIGKILL after that leaves it `manual`
 * for the life of the tmux server, which is the exact bug the feature exists to
 * fix. He runs about ten of these servers, so two booting at once is a Tuesday.
 *
 * The fix is `@agx-had-size-by`: the pid that took the mark, and that process's
 * start time so a reused pid cannot inherit the claim. Both halves are asserted
 * here, because a claim that is never released is worse than no claim at all —
 * it would strand exactly the windows the sweep is for.
 *
 * Its own tmux server, its own TMUX_TMPDIR, `-f /dev/null`: this machine's
 * config loads tmux-continuum, which restores the user's real sessions into any
 * server that starts.

 * failures to 18: `tmuxSockets` hands every server in a directory to
