// Provider filtering must never make sessions vanish (#246).
//
// `provider` is a single column on `sessions`, and a session whose model never
// resolved is stored as NULL. Filtering with `provider = ?` matched no such
// row, so those sessions disappeared from every provider-scoped view and the
// sum of the per-provider numbers came out below the unfiltered total, with no
// signal that anything was missing.
//
// The fix gives NULL a home: the "unknown" bucket (the same string the web's
// providerOf(null) returns) scopes to `provider IS NULL`, so per-provider reads
// reconcile with the total. These drive the real query layer against a throwaway
// DB. It is scoped to a private project root so the counts are exactly this
// test's events even though bun shares one DB across the suite, and the session
// assertions are restricted to this test's ids as a second guard.
