/*
 * Who did what, kept — #299.
 *
 * The cockpit performs real writes: it discards, force-pushes, merges pull
 * requests, removes containers, and answers the gate that has an agent stopped
 * at the other end of it. The only record was a ring buffer that says of itself
 * it is "a live view of the current session, not an audit trail"
 * (gitlog.ts:11), so "who approved that" had no answer at all.
 *
 * The last test is the one with a future: an audit trail with a hole in it is
 * worse than none, because you stop looking for the missing line. So the rule
 * is asserted over the routing table rather than over the four sites that
 * exist today.
