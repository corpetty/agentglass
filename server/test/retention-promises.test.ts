/*
 * SECURITY.md makes three factual claims about what is kept. These pin them.
 *
 * A security policy that has drifted from the code is worse than none: someone
 * reads "nothing in the app deletes it", plans around that, and is wrong. But
 * the claims are exactly the kind that stop being true as a side effect —
 * somebody adds a "clear history" button, or gives the rollup an expiry, and
 * the document says otherwise for as long as nobody rereads it.
 *
 * So this is a tripwire on the prose, not a ban on the feature. If one of these
 * fails because the product genuinely changed, the fix is to update SECURITY.md
 * in the same commit — which is the whole point.
