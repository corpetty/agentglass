/*
 * What this app can do to a tmux session it did not create, and the switch that
 * makes the answer "nothing".
 *
 * The differentiator and the danger are the same sentence: agentglass draws the
 * tab strip of the tmux server the USER started, so every window it can list is
 * a window it can also resize, rename, move, kill and rebind. This module's own
 * history is that sentence going wrong twice — a real session squeezed to 80x24
 * by an attach, and `resize-window -A` writing `window-size manual` across five
 * windows somebody was working in. `AGENTGLASS_TMUX_OBSERVE_ONLY=1` is the
 * answer to a stranger asking "what will this do to my tmux?": run it and it
 * does nothing at all.
 *
 * Against a real tmux server, on its own socket, with `-f /dev/null`. A mock
 * would only be able to confirm that the module called the mock politely, which
 * is not the claim — the claim is about the state of somebody's session after
 * the calls have been made, and only a session can answer that. `-f /dev/null`
 * is not decoration either: a tmux started without it reads the developer's
 * `~/.tmux.conf`, and a config with tmux-continuum in it restores their whole
 * workspace into this suite's server. That has happened here before.
 *
 * The control matters more than the assertion. Every "nothing changed" test can
 * pass by calling nothing at all, so each one runs the same sequence twice: once
 * with the switch off, where the session must come out visibly mangled, and once
 * with it on, where it must come out byte-identical.
