/*
 * A prompt nobody can answer is caught because it is ON SCREEN, not because
 * the transcript went quiet.
 *
 * The run loop watches two things while a turn is in flight: the transcript
 * file, which is what the agent has actually said, and the pane, which is what
 * it is showing. The check for "this opened a picker only a person can answer"
 * used to be gated on the FIRST — the screen was only looked at once the
 * transcript had been still for `STALL_CHECK_MS`. Those are different
 * questions, and they come apart exactly where it costs most.
 *
 * Measured on an isolated server, the same permission prompt held on screen,
 * budget 60s:
 *
 *     transcript quiet     caught at 8.98s, named for what it was
 *     transcript growing   60.2s — the entire budget, which in a real run is
 *                          45 minutes, and the recorded outcome never mentions
 *                          a prompt at all
 *
 * Anything still writing while the prompt is up lands in the second row: a
 * subagent finishing its own work, a hook, a buffered flush arriving late. The
 * turn is equally stuck; only the telling is lost.
 *
 * Both halves are locked here, because the fix is only correct if it keeps
 * what the old gate was actually FOR — a picker's key hints scrolling past in
 * ordinary output must still not kill a healthy run. That is the second test,
 * and it is the one that fails if somebody makes the first one pass by simply
 * deleting the wait.
 *
 * Against a real tmux, on its own socket and TMUX_TMPDIR: a `-L` with the
 * developer's tmpdir lands on the developer's server, and this one types.
 *
 * RUN IN A CHILD, and that is not tidiness. `claudeCode.bin()` is
 * `Bun.which("claude")`, which reads the PATH the PROCESS started with —
 * assigning `process.env.PATH` in a `beforeAll` does not move it. The first
 * version of this file did exactly that and launched the REAL agent against a
 * throwaway directory, which answered "I don't have enough context to know what
 * the thing refers to" and cost a turn of somebody's quota to learn. So the
 * stub goes on the PATH of a child process, and this file reads its verdict.
 * `understudy-verdict-capture.test.ts` writes a child test the same way.
