/*
 * THE CLI'S HALF OF "AM I ALONE IN HERE": CLI → server → window → answer.
 *
 * The relay-level contract is pinned in browser-ownership.test.ts. What that
 * file cannot see is the part an agent actually experiences: whether the notice
 * is printed, whether it goes to stderr or corrupts the JSON on stdout, and
 * whether the exit code an agent branches on is the one the docstring promises.
 *
 * Every one of those has been wrong here before. The `--make`/`--drop` flags
 * were parsed and never sent, so `profiles --drop mine` printed a success and
 * left the container where it was — measured by a peer session: 31 dropped one
 * by one, 41 still listed. A notice on stdout is the same class of failure with
 * the parties swapped: an agent pipes the answer into `jq` and gets a parse
 * error instead of a browser.
