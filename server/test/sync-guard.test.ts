/**
 * Whether a branch's upstream is its own remote copy or the base branch itself.
 *
 * The panel refuses "merge the base in" while you are behind upstream, because
 * a remote copy of your branch may already contain that merge. That reasoning
 * does not apply to a branch tracking the trunk directly — there upstream IS
 * the base, and merging it is the only way to close the gap. Getting this wrong
 * disabled the button on exactly the branches that needed it, so it is tested
 * against real clones with real tracking refs.
