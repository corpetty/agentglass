/*
 * THE SIX VERBS, END TO END, THROUGH THE CLI A SCRIPT WOULD RUN.
 *
 * A real server on its own port, an isolated tmux engine, and a `claude` that
 * is a bash script drawing a Claude-shaped screen — the input box, the "esc to
 * interrupt" of a turn in flight — and writing what it was launched with and
 * what it was told to two files. Every assertion is on an EFFECT: the argv the
 * CLI got, the text that reached its stdin, the pane that exists and then does
 * not. The verbs are exercised through bin/agentglass-agent rather than fetch,
 * because a verb that answers "ok" without doing the thing is the failure this
 * repo has had before, and the CLI is what the worker actually calls.
