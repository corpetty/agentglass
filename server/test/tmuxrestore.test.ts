   * deleting a socket file does not stop the process listening on it, which is

   *
   * And `tmux()` does not throw when the kill fails, it answers `ok: false` —
   * so the catch below never saw the one that mattered: a `kill-server` cut off
   * by the 5 s timeout on a machine deep in swap, after which the directory was
   * removed under a live server. One that did not answer is killed by pid
