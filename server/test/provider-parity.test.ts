// providerOf is derived TWICE — server-side in db.ts (which decides scope
// buckets and the sessions.provider column) and client-side in web/format.ts

// "kept in sync", but nothing enforced it: adding a model rule to one copy and
// forgetting the other would bucket the same model under two different providers
// in two panels — the #246 class of inconsistency. This pins the two together.
//
// The only intended difference is the miss value — the server returns null (the
// column is NULL), the web returns "unknown" (the label). #246 depends on that
// exact correspondence (the web's "unknown" round-trips to the server's NULL
// bucket), so it is normalised here rather than treated as a divergence.
