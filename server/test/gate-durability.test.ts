// The gate is the one feature whose job is human oversight, and it used to keep

// hook's long-poll fell into its timeout branch, and "waiting for a human"
// silently became "auto-allowed" — the worst possible failure for this feature.
//
// These tests drive the real module against a throwaway DB and simulate the
// restart by re-importing it with a fresh module registry, because the whole
// regression is "the state only existed in this process".
