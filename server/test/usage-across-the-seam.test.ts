// #292 built the rollup so the numbers outlive the rows. Nothing read it.
//
// So the dashboard kept answering "last 30d" and "all time" from the events
// table alone, which retention trims to 8 days — thirty days of label over
// eight days of data, and the difference between "we spent nothing" and "we no
// longer keep that". dailyUsage() is the join the rollup's own doc comment
// asked a caller to make.
//
// The interesting case is not "old days plus new days". It is the ONE day the
// two sources share: the prune cuts at `now - N days`, a timestamp rather than
// a midnight, so the day the cutoff lands in is half folded and half live and
// is only whole once both halves are added — while a session that ran across
// that cutoff has a row on each side and must still count once.
//
// Fixtures write daily_rollup directly instead of pruning, so the split day is
// a day this test chooses rather than whatever hour it happens to run at.
// Whether the prune folds correctly is rollup-before-prune.test.ts's question.
