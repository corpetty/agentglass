/**
 * A local review has to be reachable from the pull request it is about.
 *
 * It was not. A review was started from the plugin's own panel by typing
 * `acme/orbit#42` into a box; what it found appeared in a lane inside the
 * pull request, on another tab, in whichever project happened to hold that
 * repository; and a row in the plugin's list that named a pull request in
 * another project opened nothing at all — the panel searched for the number
 * in the repository it was already showing, which finds either nothing or
 * somebody else's pull request with the same number.
 *
 * Three things are asserted here, and each one is a way in that was missing:
 * the button in the pull request's own header, the strip on its Overview, and
 * a row anywhere in the app that opens the pull request it names, whatever
 * project is open. There is no renderer in this project, so the rule is
 * asserted against the source that draws them.
