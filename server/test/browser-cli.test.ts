/*
 * The whole chain an agent uses: CLI → server → window → answer.
 *
 * Every bug this feature had in its first day was in the seams, not in the
 * parts. The relay was tested, the page verbs were tested, and what broke was
 * a navigation reported as failed because Chromium named the *previous* one, a
 * click that answered before the page moved, and a screenshot that came back
 * empty and was passed off as a success. None of those are visible from either
 * end alone.
 *
 * So this drives the real CLI against a real server, with a stand-in for the
 * window on the other side of the socket — the one piece that cannot be real
 * without Electron. What it pins is the contract between them: that a refusal
 * exits non-zero, that an answer is printed in the shape the CLI promises, and
 * that the CLI opens the pane and retries exactly when a retry can help.

 * ── A TAB THAT IS GONE STOPS BEING YOURS ───────────────────────────────────

 * closing your own tab, or dropping your own container, left the map pointing
 * at something gone.
 *
 * That was survivable while a stale id fell through to the active tab. It is
 * not now: the fall-through is a refusal, so a stale entry is a wall. Pruning
 * had to land WITH that refusal and not before it — before it, dropping the
 * entry would have removed the victim's only current signal.
