// One invocation charges one catalog entry (#248 F9).
//
// The catalog is keyed by `kind:name`, because a project may legitimately hold
// both `.claude/skills/review/SKILL.md` and `.claude/commands/review.md`. The
// usage bucket, however, is keyed by name alone — so both entries read it. A
// single run of the *skill* was reported as two calls and twice the cost across
// the catalogue, and the command, which had never run, inherited the skill's
// last_used, its per-run cost, a place in the "top 3 most used" badge and a
// spot in the "used recently" filter instead of "to discover".
//
// The bucket only ever contains Skill-tool invocations, so where a skill of
// that name exists it is the one that ran.
