// A `git` that never returns must not keep its slot.
//
// Every awaited git takes a slot from one shared pool (see spawnpool), which
// turned a bounded annoyance into an unbounded one: before, a git that hung was
// one hung request — bad, survivable, over when the user gave up. Now it also
// holds one of at most sixteen slots for the life of the process, and a slot
// that is never handed back is gone. Enough of them and nothing in the app can
// run git at all, which is precisely the freeze the pool was added to prevent,
// reached from the other side.
//
// Not a thought experiment: prs.ts fetches PR refs from a network remote
// through this path, and a remote that accepts the connection and then says
// nothing is an ordinary Tuesday on a laptop that changed networks.
//
// The hang here is deterministic and offline — no DNS, no reachable host, no
// waiting on a real timeout. git runs its ssh command through a shell, so `sh
// -c 'sleep 30'` swallows the host and command arguments git appends and simply
// sleeps.
//
// It is set as repo config rather than GIT_SSH_COMMAND on purpose, and the
// first draft of this file got that wrong in a way worth recording: with the
// environment variable, the test passed against the *unfixed* code in 104ms.
// Bun.spawn's default env does not pick up a variable the test sets at runtime,
// so only the fixed path — which passes `{...process.env}` explicitly — ever
// saw the sleep. The test was measuring its own fix. Config lives in the repo
// and reaches git either way, which is what makes the failure real.
