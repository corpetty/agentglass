 * A new tab opens in the project on screen.
 *
 * Found with the two paths side by side: the panel's chip said the repository
 * was `~/code/orbit`, and the prompt in the tab that had just been opened said
 * `~/code/agentglass-work`. A new tab opens at the root of the project on
 * screen, always — there is no second reading of that.
 *
 * `new-window` with no `-c` starts in the SESSION's directory, and the session
 * was created by the server, so its directory is wherever the server was
 * launched from. On a desktop build that is agentglass's own install checkout —
 * which is why the wrong path was always the same wrong path, and why it looked
 * like the app was ignoring the repository rather than answering a different
 * question.
 *
 * Held on the command rather than on a running tmux: what broke is one missing
 * argument, and a server here would prove tmux honours `-c`, which is not in
 * doubt.
