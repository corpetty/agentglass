/*
 * THE QUIET AGENT IS STOPPED BEFORE THE BUDGET — and a working one is not.
 *
 * Measured before this: a live agent that printed once and then said nothing
 * ran to the task's whole budget (forty-five minutes); a dead one was noticed
 * in five seconds. Now the pane is read for CHANGE with the volatile parts
 * masked, and a pane that neither writes its transcript nor changes its screen
 * is warned at one threshold and stopped at another.
 *
 * Same shape as pane-prompt-while-talking.test.ts: a stub `claude` in a child
 * process's PATH, an isolated tmux, thresholds shrunk to seconds through the
 * environment. Three cases: quiet (stopped early, named), ticking (the
 * spinner's seconds change every frame — masked, so still quiet, stopped), and
 * working (the transcript keeps growing — never stopped for quiet).
