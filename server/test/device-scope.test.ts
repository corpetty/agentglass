/*
 * What a paired phone is allowed to do, and — the half with teeth — what it is
 * not allowed to do by default.
 *
 * The rule is deny-by-default: anything that changes state and is not named as
 * an answer is `full`. That is the direction that matters. A list of *forbidden*
 * routes fails open every time somebody adds a route and does not update it,
 * and the thing it fails open on is an interactive shell. So most of what is
 * below is written against the route table in index.ts rather than against a
 * handful of paths, so it keeps being true as that file grows.
