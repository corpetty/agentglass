// What "Whole machine" looks at — and, more to the point, what it no longer does.
//
// Discovery used to crawl the disk on the unscoped path: a conventional-homes
// guess (~/code, ~/src, …) plus the parent of every known project, each recursed
// with readdirSync to REPO_SCAN_DEPTH. On a real ~/code that speculative walk is
// pure JS/native, runs longer than its own cache, and pins a core at 99.9% while
// the terminal on the same thread freezes (reproduced by scripts/loadtest.ts with
// AGX_LOAD_WHOLE_MACHINE=1).
//
// So the walk is gone. "Whole machine" now means "the projects agentglass already
// knows about": what telemetry has seen agents run in, what the user configured,
// and agentglass's own repo. A project with none of those does not appear on its
// own — the user names it once with repoDirs. These tests pin exactly that line:
// a repo that is ONLY reachable by walking $HOME stays hidden, and the sources
// that remain each surface it.
