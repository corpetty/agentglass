/*
 * Bringing an agent back, not just the window it was in.
 *
 * The first real restore gave back six windows of login shells. `startCommand`
 * is the only thing the capture had, and tmux reports one ONLY for a pane it
 * created with a command — measured:
 *
 *   pane created as a shell, then `claude` typed into it  →  start_command ""
 *   pane created with the command                          →  start_command set
 *
 * Which is most of a real desk: people type `claude`, they do not spawn panes
 * around it. The conversation id is the missing half, and the app already
 * records it per pane.
 *
 * And the id is not merely the fallback, it is the RULE: a pane that held a
 * conversation is resumed by its id whatever line it was born from. The line
 * used to win when there was one, and the line carried the prompt — a
 * finished session's brief ran itself again after a restart (2026-09-21).
 *
 * These read the source, because building the command for real needs a CLI on
 * the PATH, which a suite must not depend on. The behaviour itself is driven
 * in restore-resumes-the-conversation.test.ts.
