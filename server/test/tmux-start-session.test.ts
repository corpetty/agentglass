/*
 * A fixture session made right after the last one was killed.
 *
 * tmux ends a server whose last session goes, and it does so after the client
 * that asked has already returned. A `new-session` in that gap connects to a
 * server on its way out and fails with "server exited unexpectedly" — or, after
 * `kill-server`, "no server running". The suites that kill their session at the
 * end of one test and make it again at the start of the next hit that gap on a
 * busy machine and on nothing else, which is why they failed only inside the
 * full run and never alone. Measured with the raw CLI: 131 of 300 immediate
 * re-creations failed after `kill-session`, 67 of 300 after `kill-server`.
 *
 * `startSession` is the fixture's answer, and this holds it to it: the same
 * loop, through the helper, never loses a session.
