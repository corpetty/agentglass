/*
 * The floating scratch, and what the app must do around it.
 *
 * One keystroke here opens a tmux popup running `tmux attach -t scratch`. That
 * is not a decoration: it is a SECOND client on the same server, it is drawn on
 * top of the first one's screen, and it holds the keyboard. Two consequences,
 * both reported from the desk and both reproduced here against a real server:
 *
 *   1. `switch-client` with no `-c` moves the most recently used client, which
 *      while a popup is open is the POPUP. So a pull request opened from the
 *      board landed inside a 60%-wide floating window instead of the terminal.
 *   2. A tab selected or created underneath the popup is a tab nobody can see
 *      or type into — "the tab shows up on top of the scratch and won't let me close it".
 *
 * These run a real tmux on an isolated socket with an empty config: the popup
 * behaviour is the thing under test, and it cannot be faked.
