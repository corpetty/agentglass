/*
 * Every route the server registers, enumerated from the source, and the rule
 * that anything which executes or mutates sits behind an Origin gate.
 *
 * `mutating-routes-guard.test.ts` next door asks the same question of a list
 * somebody typed. That list is right today and cannot stay right: `index.ts`
 * is four thousand lines carrying two hundred-odd routes and took 162 commits
 * in the last sixty days, so the failure mode is not a guard being removed —
 * it is a guard never being written, on a route the list has never heard of.
 * #469 is what that looks like at scale: 22 mutating routes on the permissive
 * gate, none of them wrong on purpose, every one copied from whichever
 * neighbour was nearest. A hand-kept list cannot catch that, because the route
 * that is missing from the code is missing from the list too.
 *
 * Nor is this something to leave until there is a second contributor to
 * protect against. Fourteen people outside this repo have already opened pull
 * requests against it; the condition passed a long time ago.
 *
 * So this file carries no list of routes. `routeTable.ts` parses `index.ts`
 * and walks out every path the dispatcher can match — 365 of them today, 184
 * of which mutate — and the assertions below apply the rule to all of them.
 * Adding a route without a gate turns this red without anybody remembering to
 * come here. What is hand-written is the two small maps: EXEMPT, for routes
 * that may answer an Origin-less caller and the reason each may, and
 * KNOWN_GAPS, for the two that should have a gate and do not.
