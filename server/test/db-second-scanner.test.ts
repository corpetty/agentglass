// A second server process on one database file silently doubled events, tokens
// and cost: the scanner read `transcript_files.lines_done` outside any
// transaction and wrote it back unconditionally, and scanner events carry
// `event_id: null` so the ingest idempotency index cannot dedupe them. Nothing
// errored; the numbers just grew. Measured on a real 354 MB history: 22
// duplicate groups out of 100,354 scanner events.
//
// Both halves of the fix are proven here the way the bug was proven — with real
// processes, not by reasoning about one. Half one: the progress marker is a
// compare-and-swap inside the batch transaction, so a racing sweep abandons its
// batch instead of re-ingesting. Half two: the database is claimed at boot, so
// the second process never starts a scanner at all, and a claim left behind by
// a SIGKILLed process is taken over rather than honoured for ever.
