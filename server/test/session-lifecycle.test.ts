// When a session is over, and when it only looks over (#248, F11 and F17).
//
// Two defects, one subject: the moment a session is called finished.
//
// F11 — a `SubagentStop` fires in the *parent* session every time a Task
// subagent finishes, several times in a long run. It was treated as terminal,
// so the parent got an `ended_at` while it went right on working: the deep dive
// showed a duration that stopped mid-run, and the fleet drew a live session as
// ended. Nothing ever cleared it, because the upsert only ever COALESCEd the
// old value forward.
//
// F17 — the detail read `started_at` from the events (MIN(timestamp)) and
// `ended_at` from the session row. Retention prunes events, so the start
// walked forward while the end stayed put, and one session reported two
// different durations depending on which panel you asked.
