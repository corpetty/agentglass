/*
 * The understudy's four tables, pinned — because this file cannot be migrated.
 *
 * server/src/db.ts has no migration system. It versions itself with CREATE
 * TABLE IF NOT EXISTS and, for a column added after the fact, an ad-hoc
 * `try { ALTER TABLE … } catch {}`. That is enough for one nullable column and
 * nothing like enough for a rename, a changed default, or a UNIQUE constraint
 * added to a table that already has rows in it on somebody's machine. So the
 * shape has to be right the first time, and these tests are what "right" means:
 * every default the ledger relies on, the uniqueness that makes a future
 * re-ingest idempotent rather than duplicative, and the external-content FTS
 * index that has to be kept in step by hand because there is not one trigger
 * anywhere in server/src.
 *
 * The last test starts a second Bun process against the SAME database file.
 * That is the case a fresh temporary directory never exercises: opening a
 * database that already has these tables and these rows in it, which is what
 * every restart on a real machine does. It has to be a no-op, and it has to not
 * throw — a CREATE that only works on an empty file would break the app on its
 * second launch and pass here for ever.
