// The order every repo picker shows.
//
// Four dropdowns read the same list — Source control's, the terminal's, the
// docked console's and the project picker — so the ordering is decided once,
// here, on the server. The rule: the project itself first, then its checkouts
// most recently worked in first. On a repo worked one-worktree-per-ticket that
// is the difference between "the branch I am on today" being at the top and
// being seventeen rows down, alphabetically, next to a ticket from March.
//
// Half of these tests exist because the cheap signals lie. `touchedAt` reads a
// commit date and one file stamp, and every cheaper thing tried first turned
// out to be rewritten by something that is not the user working — see
// touchedAt() for the list, and the last two tests here for the two that were
// written, measured against a real repo, and backed out.
