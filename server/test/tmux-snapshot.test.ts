/*
 * The safety copy of the user's last good resurrect save.
 *
 * Written after losing one. resurrect keeps every save and a `last` symlink at
 * the newest; continuum saves on a timer. A save fired while the tmux server
 * was being killed and wrote a file with ONE pane in it, `last` moved to that,
 * and the save from ten minutes earlier — five sessions, nine panes, a running
 * agent — was still on disk and no longer reachable by anything that restores:
 *
 *   19:53:17   1356 bytes   9 panes    <- the work
 *   20:03:10    166 bytes   1 pane     <- `last` now points here
 *
 * resurrect has no notion of "poorer", and agentglass must not race its timer.
 * So it keeps a copy where nothing else writes, and puts `last` back only when
 * it can prove the current one is a clobber.
 *
 * Every path here is under a scratch HOME. The module refuses the real
 * directories under NODE_ENV=test outright — this suite must never be able to
 * read, copy or repoint the developer's own resurrect saves.
