/*
 * A BOT'S APPROVAL IS NOT AN APPROVAL.
 *
 * `reviewDecision` is GitHub's own answer and counts every reviewer with write
 * access. The auto-review bot has it, so a pull request nobody had read came
 * back `APPROVED` — and the board drew a green tick on a card whose only human
 * had commented. Reported the moment it shipped: "this one is approved by
 * claude... by a bot... that doesn't count".
 *
 * It was also the app disagreeing with itself. The pull request's own Overview
 * already excluded bots and said "Reviewed, no verdict" about that same pull
 * request on the same screen — two surfaces, one truth, two answers.
 *
 * Computed from the reviews the list query already fetches, so it costs no
 * request. `reviewDecision` stays untouched beside it: some callers do want
 * "can this merge", which is what GitHub's field means.
