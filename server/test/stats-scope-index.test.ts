// A scoped /stats query must restrict to its time window inside the index, not
// scan a project's whole history (#220).
//
// Scope filters `(project_path IN (...) OR cwd_path IN (...))` and always pairs
// it with `timestamp >= since`. With a bare project_path index the planner did a
// MULTI-INDEX OR that fetched every row that project ever produced and then
// filtered the window row by row — on a project with months of history that is
// the ~400ms synchronous /stats stall the idle PTY rides. Folding timestamp into
// the index lets the same OR bound the window inside the index. The shape is the
// fix, so this pins the plan: the query plan must reach the rows through the
// composite indexes with a timestamp bound.
