// Every event counted in the window must appear in exactly one timeline bucket
// — sum(bucket events) == totals.events (#248). The 60 buckets are aligned down
// from `since` (start = floor(since/bucketMs)*bucketMs <= since), so they end at
// start + 60*bucketMs, which is <= now: the most recent up-to-(windowMs/60) of
// events fell into no bucket and vanished from the chart while still counting in
// the totals. An event at exactly `now` is always outside the aligned buckets,
// so it is the sharp case.
