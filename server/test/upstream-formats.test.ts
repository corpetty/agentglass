/*
 * Golden fixtures for the four formats this app reads but does not own.
 *
 * Tested against Claude Code 2.1.237. The transcript record set and the hook
 * payloads in test/fixtures/upstream/ were derived from a real session on that
 * version — the key sets, the content-block shapes and the `usage` object were
 * read off a live transcript — and then rewritten with invented values, so no
 * real path, project or session id is in the repository.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * Twelve server modules parse surfaces nobody here controls: the transcript
 * JSONL under the user's Claude projects directory, the JSON a hook receives on
 * stdin, and the OTLP attribute names an agent's telemetry exporter emits. None
 * of those is a published contract with a version number. When one drifts, this
 * app does not crash — it keeps working and the numbers quietly go wrong. That
 * is the whole failure mode: a renamed token attribute means the cost column
 * reads zero and looks like "agentglass cannot price my provider"; a renamed
 * transcript field means a tool call loses its name and the diff list goes
 * empty. Both were shipped bugs before this file existed.
 *
 * WHAT A FAILURE HERE MEANS — read this at 2am
 *
 * These tests do not exercise agentglass logic in isolation. They push a frozen
 * upstream document through the real production parser and compare the whole
 * derived shape at once, so a red line here says: *the fixture and the parser
 * disagree*. There are exactly two ways that happens.
 *
 *   1. You changed a parser and did not mean to change its output. The diff
 *      names the field. Fix the parser; the fixture is the older, verified
 *      answer.
 *
 *   2. Nobody touched the parser — a dependency bump or a new Claude Code
 *      brought a new shape, and you are updating the fixture to match. Then the
 *      fixture is the stale side, and updating it is a deliberate act: capture
 *      the NEW upstream document, put it in fixtures/upstream/, update the
 *      version line at the top of this comment, and check whether the parser
 *      still needs the old shape as well (it usually does — machines run old
 *      CLIs). Never edit only the expected values to make the red go away: that
 *      is how a rename gets absorbed silently, which is the exact failure this
 *      file is here to make loud.
 *
 * The fixtures are literal upstream documents with ONE exception, and it is
 * marked in the file: the transcript's `cwd` is the placeholder `__CWD__`,
 * because the scanner resolves that directory on the filesystem and refuses a
 * transcript from outside the open workspace. Everything else is byte-for-byte
 * what the parser is handed in production.
