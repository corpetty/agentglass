/*
 * The audit, and the tab a read verb reads — proved from OUTSIDE the module.
 *
 * The unit locks in browserdrive.test.ts hold `recordAudit`, `waitForEvents`
 * and `parseAsk` to their contracts. They cannot see the two lines of route
 * glue in index.ts, and glue is exactly where this failed before: `events`
 * validated a `page`, the CLI sent one, and the route built its call from
 * `since`/`wait`/`kinds` and dropped it — so all three event kinds read
 * whichever tab was in front, and the `cdp` kind DRAINED it, eating a
 * `Debugger.paused` another agent was waiting on.
 *
 * So this runs a real server, with a stand-in window on the socket answering
 * asks, and asserts what the window was actually sent — plus what the audit
 * says afterwards, and that it is still there after a restart.
 *
 * AGENTGLASS_STATE_DIR points at a temp directory on purpose: the audit log
 * now lives beside the rest of this app's state, and a test must never write
 * into the real one.
