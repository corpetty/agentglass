/*
 * A CONVERSATION IS RESUMED, NEVER REPLAYED.
 *
 * On 2026-09-21 a session the orchestrator had opened as
 * `tmux new-window "exec claude … 'Read the brief and follow it exactly.'"`
 * finished, was closed, and came back at the next restart of the app — the
 * layout file never forgets a session, which is right — and RAN THE BRIEF
 * AGAIN, because the restore replayed the line the pane was born from and the
 * prompt was on it. Each restart had also wrapped that line in one more
 * `sh -c`; it was eight deep by the time somebody read the file.
 *
 * Two rules, both driven here:
 *
 *   - a pane that held a conversation comes back as `claude <flags> --resume
 *     <id>`, whatever its born-with line said;
 *   - the flags are the process's own, minus the prompt — which is known
 *     exactly, because a prompt given on the command line reaches the same
 *     UserPromptSubmit hook as one typed at the box, and the events table
 *     has it.
 *
 * The capture half runs real tmux on its own socket with a stand-in for the
 * CLI: a shell loop given `claude` as its argv[0] (`exec -a`), which is what
 * the process walk sees. The `runArgs` half is pure.
