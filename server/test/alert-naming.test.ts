/*
 * What a notification calls the thing it is about.
 *
 * Reported by the person using it, looking at his own notification tray:
 * "agentglass:e4f85ee9 — Claude is waiting for your input". He could not tell
 * which agent it meant, could not tell which pane it was in, and it took him
 * nowhere. All three are true, and the first two are this file.
 *
 * `${source_app}:${session_id.slice(0, 8)}` names a project and eight
 * characters of a UUID. On a machine with thirty worktrees of that same
 * project it identifies nothing at all, and a notification you cannot act on
 * is one you learn to dismiss — which costs you the ones that mattered.
