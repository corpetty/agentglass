/*
 * A COMMAND THAT WILL NOT START MUST NOT COST THE WINDOW.
 *
 * The restore builds each window WITH its command inside it, and tmux closes a
 * window whose command has exited. Nothing here sets `remain-on-exit` and
 * nothing should: the understudy depends on a finished run's window closing
 * itself. So when `claude --resume <id>` cannot start — the conversation is
 * already open in another pane, the id is unknown to the CLI, the binary moved
 * — the window it was created in disappears in the same second, silently, and
 * the count still says it was restored.
 *
 * Measured on the owner's machine after a reboot on 2026-09-02: a session of five
 * windows came back with one. The four whose resume failed
 * were created and gone within the same second, `restored` said five, and he
 * rebuilt his desk by hand and told us it had not come back.
 *
 * Worse, and reproduced on an isolated server: when it is the session's FIRST
 * window, the session goes with it and tmux, left with no sessions, exits —
 * so every `new-window -t =session:` afterwards fails with "no server running"
 * and `restorePass` ignores each failure in turn.
 *
 * These tests run real tmux on their own socket, with a command that exits
 * immediately standing in for a CLI that will not start. They assert the desk,
 * not the conversation: a pane back as a shell in the right directory has lost
 * something one line recovers, a window that is not there has lost the tab.
