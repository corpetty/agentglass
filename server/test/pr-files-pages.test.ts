/*
 * Every list on a pull request is a page, and the panel used to take the first
 * one as the whole answer.
 *
 * Reported twice, an hour apart, on real branches: 275 files listed as 100, and
 * "Showing the most recent 100 commits" on one with more. Threads, comments,
 * the timeline and the check contexts all had the same cap and nobody had hit
 * them yet.
 *
 * The walk itself is `gh`, a subprocess and a network, so what is pinned here
 * is the contract around it: that the first page asks for a cursor, that later
 * pages ask for exactly the same fields as the first, that the walk is bounded,
 * and that what is still missing is still counted.
