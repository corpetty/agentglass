/*
 * Why an editor in a tmux pane had no status line.
 *
 * Reported from a real pane: nvim open, the buffer drawn at the top, blank
 * below it, and no status bar anywhere. It reads as an nvim problem and is not
 * one — the status line is on the LAST row of the pane, and the pane was taller
 * than the panel showing it.
 *
 * `window-size largest` is why, and it is there on purpose: it stops a phone
 * attaching and shrinking the desk. What nobody had measured is the other
 * direction. With something BIGGER attached — another agentglass window, a
 * `tmux attach` in a real terminal — tmux sizes the window to that one, and a
 * smaller client is shown the top-left corner of it.
 *
 * Everything here runs against a real tmux server on its own socket with
 * `-f /dev/null`, because this is a question about tmux's behaviour and a mock
 * of tmux would only be able to confirm what I already believed.
