/*
 * THE SAME INVARIANT, ONE FLOOR DOWN: a WINDOW cannot be lost either.
 *
 * `tmuxrestore-never-shrinks.test.ts` pins the session-level rule, and that
 * rule held. On 2026-09-08 the loss happened anyway, inside a session that was
 * never missing for a moment:
 *
 *   the tmux server died
 *   the engine made the session again — empty, one window
 *   the ten second sweeper photographed one window
 *   the merge saw the session in the live set and let the photograph win whole
 *   six windows of somebody's real work were gone from the file
 *   the restore then read that file, found the session already there, and
 *     skipped it — `has-session` answering a question nobody was asking
 *
 * Every step was correct at its own level. These are the two halves of the
 * fix: a photograph taken before this process has put the desk back cannot
 * shrink a session's window list, and a restore fills in the windows a live
 * session is missing instead of skipping it.
 *
 * And the third: a boot that says "not re-capturing" has to actually stop
 * capturing, which it did not.
 *
 * Against the machine's real tmux, on our own socket and our own state dir.
