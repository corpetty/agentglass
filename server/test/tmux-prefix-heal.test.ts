/*
 * The engine's prefix, when its server came up without our config.
 *
 * Reported with two screenshots: the tab strip's chip reading `C-b ENGINE`
 * while Settings ▸ Pane engine had `C-f` saved and applied — "sometimes it
 * switches to ctrl b on its own when I have it preset".
 *
 * The chip was telling the truth. `-f <conf>` is only read when the command
 * STARTS the tmux server; everything that reaches a server already running
 * inherits whatever the first command set up. An engine server born some other
 * way is therefore on tmux's own defaults — `C-b` — and stays there, because
 * `source-file` only runs when the settings are SAVED, and nobody saves a
 * setting that already says what they want.
 *
 * So the prefix is checked against the setting on every attach and the config
 * is put back when they disagree. Against a real tmux, because the whole claim
 * is about what a real server does with `-f`.
