/*
 * THE INBOX.
 *
 * Asked for first, and in these words: a tray where each agent's report
 * arrives in the fixed format without the orchestrator having to paste them
 * five times. The cost it is fixing is real and was measured on this machine —
 * the first round of statuses came back forty lines per agent, into the one
 * context that re-reads everything each turn.
 *
 * The parser's rule is the interesting one: it never refuses. A report that
 * does not use the labels is still a report, and a parser that turns a status
 * into an argument about formatting has lost the thing that mattered.
