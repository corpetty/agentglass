/*
 * WHAT WAS RUNNING COMES BACK AS THE ARGV IT WAS RUNNING WITH.
 *
 * The photograph used to keep `#{pane_start_command}` and the restore ran it
 * through `sh -c`. tmux reports that string already quoted for a shell — a
 * window made from one string, `tmux new-window "exec claude --model …"`,
 * comes back as `"exec claude --model …"` with the quotes on (measured on
 * tmux 3.7c, `args_escape`) — so `sh -c` went looking for a program called
 * `exec claude --model …`, found none, and the window died in the same
 * second. `keepTheDesk` then put a shell in its place: after a reboot the
 * owner's tabs were all shells, and the count said restored. A window made
 * from several arguments survived, one `sh -c` deeper per restart.
 *
 * So the photograph now holds what the pane's process is running, as argv
 * read off the process, and the restore hands that argv to tmux as it is:
 * exact, and never one level deeper.
