/*
 * The folders a person's projects live in, and the picker that lists only them.
 *
 * On a fresh install the picker used to fill itself from wherever an agent had
 * ever run, which on a real machine is a dotfiles checkout, an editor's config
 * repo and whatever else a session was opened in once. None of those are
 * projects anybody chose. The picker now lists what is under the folders the
 * person added and nothing else; with none added it lists nothing, and the old
 * sweep is still there behind an explicit "look for projects" — never by
 * default.
 *
 * Settings go to a scratch XDG_CONFIG_HOME, and discovery is asked through the
 * real module against real repositories in a temp directory.
