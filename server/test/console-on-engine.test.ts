/*
 * The docked console runs on the engine, in a session of its own.
 *
 * It used to be a plain PTY that died with the window, and beside it a button
 * that typed `tmux new-session -A -s …` into the shell to make it survive —
 * a BARE `tmux`, which is the machine's own server with the machine's own
 * config, borrowed to give an app shell a life of its own.
 *
 * Two things make that unnecessary: the engine already outlives the app, and it
 * is ours. The button is gone; the console is persistent by construction.
 *
 * The session name is the part worth locking. Sharing the terminal view's meant
 * two clients on one tmux session, which tmux answers by mirroring — the
 * console showed whatever the terminal showed, keystroke for keystroke, and the
 * two fought over the size. That was reported once already.
