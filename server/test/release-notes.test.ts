   * first importer in the process — `bun test` shares one process across every
   * file, so whoever imports first fixes SRC for all of them. Two sibling
   * suites already cache-bust their imports specifically to protect that, and
   * `install-stop.test.ts` does not.
   *
   * It broke exactly the way an order dependency does: green on release/app,
   * red on release/desktop-build and release/phone, from the same source — the
   * two suites differ only in which other files are in the tree. And it failed
   * in a shape that pointed away from the cause, because SRC fell back to
   * `~/.cache/agentglass/source`, which is not a repository: the two tests that
   * need the fixture's annotated tag went red, while "refuses a lightweight
   * tag" and "answers with a shape the client can always read" stayed green —
   * they expect a refusal, and a missing clone refuses too.
   *
   * Being first is not something a test file can assert or defend, so this one
   * stops requiring it.
