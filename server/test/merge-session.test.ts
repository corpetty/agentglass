/*
 * The three ways a conflict screen quietly destroys work, and the guards.
 *
 * All three were reproduced against a real repository before any of this was
 * written, because all three look fine in a mockup:
 *
 *  1. git FORGETS which files a stop conflicted. `git ls-files -u` goes from
 *     three to zero across one `git add`, and afterwards a resolved file is
 *     indistinguishable from the hundreds the merge staged on its own. Every
 *     "3 of 5 resolved" is a lie without a record.
 *
 *  2. `git checkout --merge -- <path>` — the obvious "undo" — replaces a
 *     hand-written resolution with the original markers. Exit 0. No output.
 *
 *  3. Anything can `git add` a file that still has markers in it, and from
 *     then on git considers it resolved and will commit `<<<<<<<` into the
 *     branch.
