/*
 * Which gate each route is behind, asserted against the source.
 *
 * The bug this pins is not a behaviour anybody can reach on a loopback install
 * — it is a CLASSIFICATION, and classifications drift one route at a time. #469
 * was 22 mutating routes on the permissive gate against 5 on the strict one,
 * and nothing had gone wrong: the split was where the code happened to land,
 * and every new route landed on whichever line was copied.
 *
 * So this reads `index.ts` and checks the pairing, which is the only form of
 * this test that fails when somebody adds a route rather than when somebody
 * breaks one. A running-server test would need `AGENTGLASS_BIND=0.0.0.0` to
 * show any difference at all, which is the one configuration a test must not
 * create on a developer's machine.
