/*
 * A person's own suspend wins over "agents are working".
 *
 * The Linux half of staying awake was one `systemd-inhibit` holding
 * `sleep:handle-lid-switch` in BLOCK mode. A block inhibitor on `sleep` does
 * exactly what it says to every suspend, the one a person asks for from the
 * menu included: `systemctl suspend` answers "Operation inhibited" and nothing
 * happens. Measured on the owner's machine — with an agent mid-turn the
 * suspend entry did nothing at all, with no word on screen about why.
 *
 * So the two halves of the assertion are held separately, each in the only
 * mode that fits it:
 *
 *   sleep              BLOCK-WEAK — enforced against logind's own idle action
 *                                   and not against the user who holds it, so
 *                                   the menu's suspend goes through and the
 *                                   machine still does not doze off. BLOCK on
 *                                   a logind too old for it (before 257), which
 *                                   refuses the mode at once: there, block IS
 *                                   weak — honoured for everyone but the user
 *                                   who holds it — and delay holds nothing.
 *   handle-lid-switch  BLOCK      — closing the lid on a running agent must not
 *                                   end the run; logind offers no weak or delay
 *                                   mode for a lid switch.
 *
 * And the moment logind says it is going down, the sleep lock is let go at
 * once.
 *
 * Driven for real in a child process, with a stubbed `electron` and a
 * `systemd-inhibit` on PATH that writes down how it was called.
