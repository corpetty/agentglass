/*
 * The one gate standing between a paired phone and this user's secrets.
 *
 * `/machine/process` lists a process's environment with credential-looking
 * values masked; `/machine/env` hands one back in the clear. The masking is
 * tested at the module level (proc-detail.test.ts). What is NOT testable there
 * is the thing that actually protects it: the reveal route is gated on
 * `desktopOnly` rather than `localOrigin`, so it can only be called from the
 * app's own scheme — not from a phone that paired, not from a browser tab, not
 * from curl.
 *
 * That difference is one identifier in index.ts. Downgrading it to
 * `localOrigin`, which is what every neighbouring route uses, would leave every
 * test in this repo green and quietly publish the user's API keys to anything
 * holding a device credential. Hence a test that speaks HTTP.
