/*
 * The shared-tree flag, end to end: hooks in, the Diff view's list out.
 *
 * sharedtree.ts is tested as a function; this is the wiring around it, which
 * is where a correct function most easily says nothing — the list is read from
 * a cache, the checkouts come from a sweep, the liveness from the rollup, and a
 * field that is computed and never attached looks exactly like "no tree is
 * shared". Two sessions edit one file in a repo while a third works in a linked
 * worktree of it: the repo has to come back with the first two as its authors
 * and that file as their overlap, and the worktree with the third alone.
