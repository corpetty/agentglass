/*
 * A session made for a run holds the run, and nothing else.
 *
 * `new-session -d -s x` with no command opens the user's login shell in a
 * window nobody asked for, and the run's window was made one command later —
 * so every session this app created for a run carried a dead shell forever.
 * Nothing closes it: it is not leased, not swept, not named after anything, and
 * it keeps the session alive after the real windows are gone.
 *
 * It was found the way these are found — by looking at a strip. A stray `fish`
 * sat beside the clone's work in `agentglass-understudy`, cwd the project, born
 * at the second the run started, its parent tmux itself. Reproduced on an
 * isolated server: THREE windows for TWO runs.
 *
 * One per session rather than one per run, which is the part worth being
 * precise about — it appears each time the session is recreated, not each time
 * somebody presses a button.
 *
 * The fix is this file's neighbour's answer: `tmuxrestore` has always created
 * the session WITH its first real window, using `new-window` only for the rest.
 * tmux prints `-P -F` ids for `new-session` exactly as it does for
 * `new-window`, and takes `-n` and `-e` on both, so the two argument lists are
 * interchangeable — measured on tmux 3.6a before the code was written.
 *
 * Against a real tmux, isolated on its own socket and TMUX_TMPDIR: a `-L` with
 * the developer's tmpdir lands on the developer's server, and this test counts
 * windows — on his machine it would count HIS.
