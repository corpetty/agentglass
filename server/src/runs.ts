/*
 * A run: one question, asked in several checkouts at once, and tracked as one
 * thing.
 *
 * The obvious half of this is fan-out — cut N worktrees, start N agents, keep
 * the best. That half is not what this file is for, and it is worth being blunt
 * about why: everybody ships it. It is Orca's headline feature, Cursor has
 * best-of-n across eight agents, and Claude Code itself will spawn a worktree
 * per agent from a flag. Arriving fourth at a race that is already run is not a
 * reason to write anything.
 *
 * The half nobody else can do is ADOPTION, and it is the reason this exists.
 * A person opens a terminal, cuts a worktree by hand, and starts a different
 * vendor's CLI in it — codex, gemini, whatever they were already using. Nothing
 * in the app spawned it, nothing in the app configured it, and every tool that
 * manages agents can only manage what it started: they hold a handle they were
 * given at spawn time, and there is no handle here to hold. Even a vendor's own
 * cross-session registry misses it, because a session appears there when it
 * binds an inbox socket and a codex pane never binds one.
 *
 * This app is in a different position, and only because of what it already
 * measures. It can see every tmux pane on the machine, it can see which
 * DIRECTORY the agent inside a pane is genuinely running in (paneloc.ts, and
 * note that this is not the shell's directory — that distinction is the whole
 * reason that file exists), and it can ask git which of those directories is a
 * checkout of the repository in question. Those three facts are enough to say
 * "that pane, over there, that we did not start, is working on this" — which is
 * what a leg of a run is.
 *
 * So a run has legs of two origins and they are deliberately not equal:
 *
 *   spawned   we cut the worktree and started the agent, so we may tear both
 *             down again when the run is over.
 *   adopted   somebody else's pane in somebody else's checkout. Tracked, shown
 *             beside the others, counted in the run — and NEVER torn down.
 *             Deleting a checkout a person made by hand because they let us
 *             watch it is the single worst thing this feature could do, and a
 *             tool that does it once is a tool nobody adopts a pane into twice.
 *
 * On grouping. A run does not get a column in the events table and nothing is
 * tagged at write time. What ties a leg's stored history to the run is its
 * DIRECTORY: db.ts already generates `cwd_path` — a virtual generated column on
 * `events`, a backfilled real one on `sessions` — so asking "what happened in
 * this set of directories" answers over rows that were written long before any
 * of this existed. That is what makes a pane adoptable an hour after the fact
 * rather than only at the moment it starts: the history is already there, under
 * the only key that was ever going to be common to an agent we started and one
 * we did not.

 *      the session in question running somewhere else entirely.
 *   2. Nothing, when a pane holds two agents. Two agents under one pane is an
 *      ordinary day, and picking one of them would be a confident wrong answer
 *      with no way to notice. Declining is the honest end of the question, and
 *      the caller has a sentence for it.
 *   3. The shell's directory, only when no agent is visible at all — a machine
 *      without `/proc`, or a CLI nobody has heard of. It is the weak answer, so
 *      it is only allowed through if git confirms it is a checkout of this
 *      run's repository, which is a much harder test than "it is a directory".
 *
 * Then git decides whether it belongs here. `worktrees(root)` lists every
 * checkout of this repository — the main one, the ones we cut, and the ones
 * somebody cut by hand years ago, which is precisely the case this feature is
 * for. A directory git does not list is not part of this repository, whatever

 * event payload — see db.ts, where it is added with `GENERATED ALWAYS AS
 * (json_extract(payload, '$.cwd')) VIRTUAL` — so it applies to rows written
 * before this file existed, with no backfill pass over a multi-gigabyte table.
 * On `sessions` it is a real column that the same migration backfills from
 * those events.
 *
 * That is what makes ADOPTION retroactive rather than a subscription. A pane
 * somebody started three hours ago has three hours of history in there already,
 * filed under the directory it ran in; adopting it does not start collecting,
 * it starts LOOKING. A run tagged at write time could only ever have shown what
 * happened after somebody pressed a button.
 *
 * `IN (…)` over the leg set rather than a query per leg: one statement, and the
 * index db.ts builds on `cwd_path` is what it plans against.
 *
 * The BILL is asked for separately, and from `events` rather than `sessions`,
 * because a run with two vendors in it has to report two bills and the sessions
 * table cannot say that. `sessions.provider` is one column set
 * first-non-null-wins — db.ts says so where it adds the per-event column — so a
 * session that ran Opus and then GPT reports all of its money under whichever
 * of the two was seen first. A run exists to compare vendors, so a total that
 * silently attributes one vendor's spend to another is not a rounding problem,
 * it is the answer being wrong. Each event carries its own `provider`, derived
 * from the model that produced it, and `idx_events_provider_ts` is the index
 * that makes asking cheap.
