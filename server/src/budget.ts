 *
 * A budget is deliberately three things: how much, over what period, for what.
 * Not a rate, not a forecast, not a per-session cap. "£40 a month on this

 * hour averaged over a trailing window" is not, and the second kind of setting
 * is the kind that gets set once and never understood again.
 *
 * Evaluated against the rollup as well as live events, which is what #292 made
 * possible: on a default install raw events are kept for eight days, so before
 * that a monthly budget was a weekly budget wearing a monthly label.

 * and which no prefix test will ever match — and that is exactly the rule
