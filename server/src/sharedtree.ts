/**
 * Who is writing into each working tree — and where that is more than one.
 *
 * The Diff view groups its rows by checkout, and when every agent has a
 * worktree of its own that grouping is attribution: the section for
 * `orbit-WEB-1042` is that agent's work and nobody else's. When two agents
 * write into ONE checkout it stops being true without anything on screen
 * changing — the section is both of them, and a file both of them edited has a
 * single on-disk diff that no grouping can split by author. The view would
 * present a confident answer to a question the working tree cannot answer.
 *
 * So this says when it happens, and which files are the ones that cannot be
 * split: the overlap. A tree two sessions wrote to without sharing a file is
 * still flagged — the heading names two authors either way — but only the
 * overlap is genuinely approximate, and the two are reported apart so the
 * screen can be exact about which is which.
 *
 * The tree is decided by where a session WROTE, never by where it stands. An
 * agent commonly runs from the parent repo and reaches into its worktree with
 * absolute paths (see panewt.ts: every process in such a pane reports the
 * parent as its cwd), so "same cwd" would flag every agent in a fleet as
 * sharing the parent while each of them writes only to its own checkout. That
 * is a flag that is always on, which is a flag nobody reads.
 *
 * The ceilings, chosen:
 *
 *   * only Edit, Write and MultiEdit are counted — the tools whose hooks name
 *     the file. A session that changes files through the shell (`sed -i`, a
 *     code generator, a formatter) is not seen as an author here;
 *   * a pane vouches for an agent only on Linux, where its processes' cwds can
 *     be read (paneloc.ts). Elsewhere an agent quiet for LIVE_MS stops counting
 *     however long its pane stays open;
 *   * a pane note is keyed by pane id alone, and ids are per tmux server, so
 *     a same-numbered pane on a second server with an agent in the same
 *     directory can vouch for the wrong session. Inherited from `paneDirs`.
