// Real-terminal backend — a PTY-backed interactive shell per WebSocket.
//
// The browser panel is a true machine terminal (xterm.js in front): the server
// spawns the user's login shell inside a pseudo-terminal in a chosen
// repo/worktree and shuttles raw bytes over the socket. Job control, colors,
// cursor addressing, vim/htop/lazygit — everything a local terminal does.
//
// PTY strategy (best available, in order):
//   1. python3 + pty_bridge.py — full PTY with live resize (SIGWINCH), the
//      normal path on macOS/Linux (python3 is already an agentglass prereq).
//   2. util-linux `script -qfec` — full PTY, fixed initial size (Linux).
//   3. plain pipes — degraded (no TUI apps) but still a usable shell.
//
// Shells run in their OWN session/process group (via `setsid`) so hangup on
// socket close reaches the whole job tree, not just the shell. Gated by
// AGENTGLASS_TERMINAL_DISABLED; cwd must be a real git dir; the CSRF/origin
// guard is applied at the upgrade route.

       *    them on the mirror.

/**
 * Hang up every live shell, remove their temp dirs, and give the user's tmux
 * back everything a phone borrowed from it.
 *
 * Called when the server is going down: a plain exit only reaps children the
 * kernel happens to HUP, and the `script`/pipe fallbacks have no such
 * guarantee, so a killed server would otherwise leave orphaned shells and /tmp
 * dirs behind.
 *
 * THE TMUX HALF WAS MISSING, and it is the fault this shape exists for. This
 * function is wired to SIGINT/SIGTERM in index.ts with `process.exit(0)` on the
 * next line. It never called `cleanup`, so `restoreWindows` never ran — and
 * restarting the server left the desk's window at the phone's 80x24 with
 * `window-size manual` written on it, on every window of that session, for
 * ever, with nothing on screen to explain it. Measured on a private server
 * (tmux 3.6a, `-f /dev/null`): with a fitted phone attached and its client
 * killed, the window still reads `80x24`, `window-size manual`,
 * `window_zoomed_flag 1`. Nothing puts that back on its own. It is the same
 * fault that pinned seven of the user's windows, arriving through a different
 * door.
 *
 * WHAT "RESTORE ON THE WAY OUT" MEANS WITH NO TIME TO BE ASYNCHRONOUS.
 *
 * `cleanup` is allowed to wait, and does: +1500ms and +3000ms, because tmux
 * takes a moment to notice a client has gone and `restoreWindows` skips any
 * window a phone is still on. A shutdown has no moment — `process.exit(0)`
 * would not let a timer run, and deferring to a next tick that never arrives is
 * the same as not restoring at all.
 *
 * So the precondition is MADE TRUE instead of waited for. `endPhoneSession`
 * kills the grouped session this app made for that phone, which measured on a
 * private server is gone from the very next `list-sessions` — the same call
 * `phoneWindows` makes. `restoreWindows` then runs exactly as it does on the
 * timer path, unmodified, skipping nothing it should not. No bypass flag: a
 * teardown that could be told to ignore "a phone is still on this window" is
 * one argument away from being the bug it was written to prevent.
 *
 * Two passes, and the order decides the outcome twice.
 *
 * Every phone session is ended BEFORE anything is restored: with two phones on
 * one window, restoring after ending only the first finds the window still busy
 * and skips it — a restore that silently does nothing is the original bug, not
 * a smaller version of it.
 *
 * And the restores run newest first so the OLDEST capture is applied last and
 * wins. Two fitted phones on one window: the first captured the window's real
 * `window-size` (usually nothing), the second captured the `manual` the first
 * one's fit had already written. In attach order the window keeps `manual` —
 * which is the pinning this whole function is fixing, put back by the fix.
 *
 * Synchronous throughout: every tmux call underneath is a `spawnSync`. Measured
 * on a private server, one fitted phone on a three-window session — eleven tmux
 * calls — at 17.2ms, 15.4ms and 14.3ms over three runs. That is what a signal
 * handler can afford to spend before `process.exit(0)`, and it is the number to
 * re-measure if this ever grows a loop over something unbounded.
 *
 * RESIDUAL, both named rather than papered over:
 *
 *  - SIGKILL, an OOM kill, and the power going out. No handler runs there at
 *    all. The status line survives that because it writes `@agx-owned` onto the
 *    session and `releaseStale` sweeps it on the next run's first contact with
 *    that server; `window-size` has no such mark, so a later run cannot tell a
 *    `manual` we wrote from one the user set, and guessing would cost somebody
 *    their own option to fix a squeeze they never had.
 *  - A window the desk took back in the last ten seconds is skipped by
 *    `restoreWindows`, deliberately. It is already at the desk's size, and the
 *    `largest` it carries is `takeover`'s own effect — the user asking to stop
 *    following the newest client — not the phone's squeeze. A window on
 *    `largest` still follows the desk's terminal (measured in `runAction`: the
 *    desk going to 160x45 takes it to 160x44), so this is not the pinning.
