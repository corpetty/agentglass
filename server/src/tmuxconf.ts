// The config agentglass's own tmux server runs with, and the gate that keeps a
// bad one from ever applying.
//
// The pane engine never loads the user's ~/.tmux.conf — it runs `-f` with a
// config of our own (tmuxpane.ts documents the measured reason: the user's
// config loads tpm, which loads tmux-continuum, whose autosave would write our
// chat panes over the user's own resurrect saves). What a user CAN do is edit
// the config for *our server only*, from the settings panel:
//
//   "append"  — generated base conf, then the user's override lines;
//   "replace" — the override lines are the whole config.
//
// Everything goes through validateConf() before it is allowed to exist on
// disk: a broken config must leave the pane engine off with a reason, never
// take the chat down with it. The user's tmux is not involved in validation —
// the check runs on a scratch socket under a scratch TMUX_TMPDIR, so even a
// plugin that fires during the check writes into temp, not into
// ~/.tmux/resurrect.
//
// One more rule, from the panel's standpoint: the agentglass UI owns the tabs
// and the status line. Our server runs `set -g status off` (tmux's own status
// bar is the one thing the UI replaces), and in append mode that line is
// re-asserted after the user's override so a stray `set -g status on` in it
// cannot fight the UI. Replace mode is the user's config and their call.

/**
 * A tab whose PROGRAM failed stays, dead, with the status on it. A shell that
 * exits closes as it always did.
 *
 * tmux's default closes a window the instant its command exits, and for a
 * program that crashed that is a tab gone from the strip in the same second
 * with nothing to say why: five tabs running agent CLIs, each started by hand
 * with `tmux new-window "cli …"` and so without the wrapper this app's own
 * windows carry, vanished over one afternoon (2026-09-21). `failed` keeps the
 * pane for a non-zero status or a signal, so the tab reads "Pane is dead
 * (status 1, …)" where the program was.
 *
 * Not for a pane born as a plain shell, and that is the hook: an interactive
 * shell exits with the status of its LAST command, so `false` then Ctrl-D
 * would leave every Terminal tab, console and bench as a corpse (measured).
 * A pane tmux started with no command has an empty `pane_start_command`, and
 * `pane-died` — which only fires for a pane kept by this option — closes it
 * on the spot. The windows this app opens and watches for their exit set the
 * option back to off on themselves (panelease.ts, agentops.ts).
 *
 * `pane-died` alone is not enough, so a shell pane is also born with the option
 * off. Under `failed`, tmux keeps a pane until it has the exit status, and a
 * tmux built with libutempter — Debian's and Ubuntu's are — can lose that
 * SIGCHLD: the library resets the handler to SIG_DFL around its own helper, a
 * child that exits in that window is never reaped, and the pane stays dead
 * with no status and no `pane-died`. Measured on Ubuntu 24.04's tmux 3.4 with
 * `exit 0`: a corpse 8 times in 10; the same source built without utempter,
 * 0 in 10. Off from birth, a shell's pane closes on the pty's end and never
 * waits for the status. A pane with a command still waits, and on such a
 * build can still be kept when it ended cleanly; that is the next thing and
 * it is not here.
 *
 * `failed` is a tmux 3.2 value; an older tmux would refuse the whole line and
 * report it on the first attach, so it is left out there.
