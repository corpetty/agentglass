/*
 * How each agent on the roster is STARTED in a terminal.
 *
 * This is a different question from the one paneagent.ts asks, and the two are
 * deliberately not the same file. `PaneAgent` is the contract the chat engine
 * needs — where the transcript is, what an end of turn looks like, which entry
 * types reach the browser — and only Claude Code can currently answer it,
 * because only Claude Code writes a structured transcript this app knows how to
 * read. Everything here needs far less: a binary, and the handful of words that
 * binary wants on its command line. A tmux window running a CLI interactively
 * does not care whether anybody can parse what it writes.
 *
 * That gap is why "a run leg names its own agent" did not work before this
 * file existed. `startRun` already took a roster id per leg and already
 * resolved it to a binary — and then built the command line with `agentArgv`,
 * which spells the permission flag `--dangerously-skip-permissions` because
 * that is Claude Code's spelling. Handed to `codex` that is an unknown flag,
 * and an unknown flag does not degrade: the CLI prints usage and exits, so the
 * window opens, flashes and closes. A two-vendor run would have produced one
 * working leg and one that looked like tmux was broken.
 *
 * The spellings below are not invented here. Each one is already written down
 * somewhere in this server, against a CLI somebody ran:
 * `--dangerously-skip-permissions` in claudecode.ts and agentticket.ts,
 * `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` in codex.ts, and Antigravity's
 * own `--dangerously-skip-permissions` in antigravity.ts. What is new is that
 * they sit in one table keyed by the same roster id the rest of the app uses,
 * instead of being a Claude constant that three call sites reach for.
 *
 * And they are still ASKED rather than trusted, for the reason claudecode.ts
 * gives about `--name`: the answer is a property of whichever version happens
 * to be on this machine, and getting it wrong costs the window rather than a
 * feature. One `--help` per binary per process is a cheap way never to hand a
 * CLI a word it will refuse to start with.

 * positional argument in the one place both terminal paths already share. This
