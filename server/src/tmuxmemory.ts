/*
 * Which tmux server this app was last working in, remembered across restarts.
 *
 * The reason is a complaint with a repro: close agentglass, reopen it, and the
 * session you were in is not on offer — you have to go to a terminal outside
 * the app and `tmux attach -t <name>` before it will show you anything. After
 * a rebuild, every time.
 *
 * It is self-inflicted, and it takes two losses to happen. The panel's client
 * is usually the ONLY client on that server, so closing the app detaches the
 * session; `listPanes` then skips any server with no client at all, so the
 * session agentglass just put down is the one it refuses to show. And
 * `lastTarget` — the only place the socket was ever written — lives in a module
 * variable, so it dies with the process: on the next run the app does not even
 * know which of the machine's tmux servers was yours.
 *
 * This fixes the second loss, which is what makes the first one fixable: a
 * socket we were demonstrably attached to is not a stray, whatever the client
 * count says now. The filter it lets through is doing a real job otherwise —
 * this project's own suite leaves servers behind on scratch sockets, and a
 * resurrect config restores real sessions into them, so an unattached server
 * CAN be a convincing duplicate of the one you work in. The rule is not "show
 * every detached server"; it is "a server this app has used is one it may
 * still see".
 *
 * Nothing here touches the user's tmux. It is a file of our own, next to the
 * rest of our settings, and deleting it costs a session's memory and nothing
 * else.
