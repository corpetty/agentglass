 * Slice 2: the box itself. Slice 3 adds the network split — `sandboxArgv`'s

 * may ask for, it only decides how what was already approved gets mounted.
 *
 * Three pieces, kept separate on purpose:
 *  - `sandboxProbe` asks the HOST once whether bwrap can build a box at all.
 *  - `resolveGrants`/`resolvePrograms` turn a manifest's `~/…` spellings into
 *    real, re-checked paths — this is where a symlink pointed at a secret
 *    gets caught, because `validateSandbox` in shared/pluginSandbox.ts only
 *    ever saw the spelling, not the filesystem.
 *  - `sandboxArgv` is pure: given every fact already resolved, it is just
 *    argv, and a test can pin its exact shape without a working bwrap.
