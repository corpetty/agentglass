/**
 * Updating the app to the newest released tag.
 *
 * Two decisions shape everything here, and both were mistakes first.
 *
 * It tracks TAGS, not a branch. A branch tip is wherever development happened
 * to stop — half a feature, a debugging commit, whatever got pushed at six in
 * the evening. Tagging is the act of saying "I tested this", and an update
 * button that ignores it ships untested code to the one machine that matters.
 * Tags also make rollback trivial and match how a real release feed works, so
 * moving to one later changes the transport and nothing else.
 *
 * It builds from ITS OWN CLONE, never the developer's checkout. The first
 * version pulled in the working directory, which meant a convenience button
 * could move somebody's HEAD, and needed a thicket of guards — clean tree,
 * right branch, fast-forward — to be merely survivable. A private clone under
 * the cache needs none of them: nothing there is ever edited, so checking out a
 * tag is always safe, and the developer's repository is never touched at all.
 *
 * It is still not an auto-updater — it compiles on the machine, which is only
 * reasonable because that machine already has the toolchain. And it remains the
 * most dangerous route in the server, since it runs whatever the tag contains,
 * so it is reachable from the desktop shell alone.
