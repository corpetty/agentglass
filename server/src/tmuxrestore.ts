// Layout and scrollback persistence for the pane engine's own tmux server.
//
// The engine's tmux server survives app restarts (it is a daemon of its own),
// so "quit and reopen the app" needs nothing here. What needs this is the case
// tmux itself cannot answer: the host rebooted, the daemon died with it, and
// the panes are gone — sessions, splits and scrollback included. This module
// periodically photographs the layout and the scrollback of every pane on OUR
// socket, and on demand rebuilds the whole tree in a fresh server.
//
// What a restore gives back, in order of decreasing fidelity:
//
//   * the session/window/pane tree, each pane's working directory and size;
//   * each pane's scrollback (up to 2000 lines, replayed into the new pane);
//   * what was RUNNING in each pane, as the argv it was running with — an
//     agent CLI, or whatever command the pane was born from. "all" mode brings
//     it back: a Claude conversation is resumed by its id, any other program is
//     started again with the same argv, and a prompt that was on a command
//     line is never sent a second time (see `runArgs`); "lazy" (default)
//     restores the tree and lets the chat reopen resume each session.
//
// Nothing here touches the user's tmux. Only the engine's own socket is read,
// and the data lands in the engine's state dir. The user's ~/.tmux/resurrect
// saves are nobody's business but theirs (see tmuxsnapshot.ts).

 * except one. The tmux daemon itself never died: it is a separate process and
 * it survived every crash. What was lost was this bookkeeping.
 *
 * The mechanism, and it is worth stating because the fix follows from it
 * exactly: each restart ran `captureLayout()`, which photographed whatever
 * sessions happened to be alive at that instant and OVERWROTE this file with
 * that set. Mid-restore, that set was small. The next restart read the smaller
 * file, saw those sessions already existed, and did nothing. The recorded
 * state could only ever shrink, never grow back. The one that survived was
 * simply whichever session outlasted the final interruption.
 *
 * So the invariant is: a session missing from a live snapshot is NOT evidence
 * that it should be forgotten — until this process has put the desk back on
 * this engine. Before that it might be gone; it might be mid-restore; the
 * app might be in the middle of dying. After that, a session that leaves is
 * one somebody closed (see `writeMerged`), and an explicit close removes an
 * entry at any time — `forgetSession`.

 *
 *   1. A CONVERSATION IS RESUMED, NEVER REPLAYED. A pane that held a Claude

 *      command line it was born from. The born-with line used to win here
 *      whenever there was one, and it carried the prompt: a session the
 *      orchestrator had opened with `claude … 'Read the brief and follow
 *      it'`, finished and closed, was rebuilt at the next restart and RAN THE
 *      BRIEF AGAIN — measured on 2026-09-21, tokens included. Worse, each
 *      restart wrapped the line in one more `sh -c`: eight deep by the time
 *      it was read. The id is the conversation; the flags are the desk; the
 *      prompt was said once.
 *   2. Any other program comes back as the argv it was running with
 *      (`startArgv`), passed to tmux as argv, so it is exact and never one
 *      level deeper. (tmux runs a ONE-word argv through the login shell —
 *      its own rule for a single argument — which for a bare program name
 *      is the same program.)
 *   3. A photograph from before `startArgv` existed still has the string tmux
 *      reported, and gets the old `sh -c` on it: right for a line tmux
 *      printed unquoted, a shell for one it quoted, and gone at the first
 *      sweep after boot.
 *
 * The id came from our own hook or from a running process's arguments, and

 * command ended cleanly, and the engine keeps one whose command failed as a
 * dead pane (tmuxconf.ts) — either way it is not the pane that was asked for.
 *
 * So the failure is: `claude --resume <id>` cannot start — the conversation is
 * already open in another pane, the id is unknown to the CLI, the binary moved
 * — it exits, and the window goes with it. Measured on this user's machine
 * after a reboot: a session of five windows came back with one, the four whose
 * resume failed vanished in the same second they were made, and the count said
 * five. He rebuilt his desk by hand.
 *
 * Checking immediately proves nothing: `new-window` returns as soon as tmux has
 * forked, and a CLI that fails takes a few hundred milliseconds to say so. One
 * wait for the whole pass, not one per window, so a desk of ten windows pays it
 * once. A command that dies later than this still slips through, and that is
 * stated rather than pretended away — the sweeper that runs afterwards is what
 * covers the slow ones.
