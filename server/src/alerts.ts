//
// Both of these leave the process, and neither is guaranteed to arrive. In
// particular `notify-send` hands the notification to the desktop's daemon,
// which is free to hold it: with Do Not Disturb on it is queued silently and
// the command still exits 0, so there is no failure for this file to see. That
// is fine for "an agent errored", and not fine for a gate hold, where an agent
// is stopped until a human answers. The durable route for those is in-app --
// web/src/lib/gateStore.ts raises every new hold onto the notch, which no
// desktop setting can suppress. Treat everything below as best-effort reach
// for when nobody is looking at agentglass at all.
