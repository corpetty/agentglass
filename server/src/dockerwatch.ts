/*
 * Watching containers finish, so the ledger can say who wrote what.

 * `docker events` is the only place the daemon volunteers "this container just
 * ended". Everything else about volume ownership follows from that moment: the
 * container that is exiting still exists, so it can be inspected, and its
 * read-write volume mounts plus its compose `working_dir` label are exactly the
 * pair the ledger needs.
 *
 * Deliberately small and deliberately quiet:
 *
 *   - one process for the whole machine, not one per panel;
 *   - one `docker inspect` per container that ENDS, which on a normal day is a
 *     handful, and zero while nothing is happening;
 *   - it never blocks anything. If the watcher is not running, volumes simply
 *     read "unknown", which is the state the app has been in since it existed.
