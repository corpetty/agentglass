// A lease on a tmux window THIS server opened, and the only thing allowed to
// close one.
//
// The pane engine already reclaims memory, and it does it the way a memory
// optimisation is usually done: `evictIdlePanes` lists every session on our
// socket and kills the ones nothing has touched in thirty minutes. That is the
// right shape for chat panes, whose names this app mints, and it is the wrong
// shape for everything a run opens — for two measured reasons.
//
//   - It cannot see them. A run opens a WINDOW inside the checkout's engine
//     session (`engineWindowRunning`); the sweeper enumerates SESSIONS and
//     `killPane` kills a session. So an interactive agent left in a run window
//     is invisible to the only cleanup there is, and stays resident until
//     somebody notices. Measured on this machine while writing this: 24
//     `claude` processes, 5.5GB resident, the largest 1028MB, several alive 50
//     hours.
//   - Widening it to windows would be worse than the leak. Eight of those 24
//     are the user's OWN work, in another repository, 43 to 51 hours old, and
//     they are continued tomorrow morning. A sweep that decides from what a
//     window LOOKS like — a name that starts with `understudy:`, a `claude` in
//     a worktree shaped like ours, an age — is one heuristic away from killing
//     one of those, and being wrong once costs more than the feature saves.
//
// So closing is never inferred. A window this app opens is STAMPED at the
// moment it is opened, with a random token nothing else can produce, and the
// stamp is recorded. Closing reads the stamp back off that exact window id and
// refuses unless it matches the token recorded for it. Nothing is enumerated,
// no name is matched, no age is consulted: the only candidates are the ones in
// our own record, and each of them still has to prove it is the window we
// stamped.
//
// Why the stamp as well as the id: tmux window ids (`@7`) are unique per tmux
// SERVER, not for ever. Our engine survives this process — that is the point of
// it — but it does not survive a reboot or a `kill-server`, and after one the
// ids start again at `@0`. A record written before that restart would then name
// a window somebody else opened, and the first `@0` on the engine is the user's
// own terminal view. The stamp is what makes a stale record inert instead of
// dangerous.
//
// The record is on disk rather than in memory because the failure this exists
// for includes the server restarting mid-run: the process that knew about the
// window is gone, the window is not.
