// server saves to. Two servers, one save file: fifteen minutes later the user's
// real layout has been overwritten with our chat panes, and they find out at the
// next boot restore. Measured on a live machine, not hypothesised.
//
// So every call carries BOTH `-L` (our socket) and `-f` (our config). The config
// below is deliberately tiny; it exists to stop tmux reaching for the user's.
//
// The user's server is never touched, never read, never attached to. Theirs is
// theirs. `tmux ls` in their terminal cannot see any of this, and ours cannot see
// their sessions — which is also what makes `tmux -L agentglass attach` a safe
