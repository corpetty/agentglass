 * ~/.gemini/antigravity-cli holds a quota figure, its conversation DBs carry no
 * usage fields, and its own log shows a quota_manager that refreshes into
 * process memory and never writes it down. The only route left would be
 * replaying its authenticated backend call, which is out of scope.
 *
 * Shown rather than hidden, because a provider that is simply missing from the
 * list reads as a bug in agentglass, while one that says why reads as the
 * upstream limitation it is.
