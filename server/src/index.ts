 * does" and nothing else moved until it was over. You could not see which file
 * it was in, what it had tried, or whether it was stuck — the difference
 * between watching popcorn being made and being handed a bag.
 *
 * So the work happens in a tmux window in the project's own engine session,
 * which is the same machinery every other pane in this application already
 * uses: it can be watched, scrolled, interrupted, and typed into.
 *
 * THE PIECES THAT ARE NOT OBVIOUS.
 *
 * The prompt goes in a FILE. It is thousands of characters of rules and
 * precedents, and a command line has a length limit that varies by kernel; a
 * brief that grows past it would fail as something unrelated.
 *
 * `tee` rather than a redirect, because both things are wanted at once: the
 * pane is for the person and the file is for the outcome row.
 *
 * `PIPESTATUS[0]` rather than `$?`. Through a pipe, `$?` is tee's exit code,
 * which is zero whatever the agent did — the run would be recorded as finished
 * no matter how it ended. That is bash-only, hence bash rather than sh.
 *
 * The exit code lands in a FILE, and that file is the signal the run is over.
 * A window is gone the moment its command ends, so waiting on the window is a
 * race with reading it.
 *
 * Returns null when there is no tmux, or when the window could not be opened,
 * and the caller falls back to the hidden spawn. Watching is worth a lot and
 * it is not worth being the reason nothing runs.

emits JSON: measured at roughly two hundred characters a line, most of it

 * by accident — it admits an Origin-less caller on loopback because that is
 * precisely who the hooks are, and the hook POSTing `/gate` (asking to be held)
 * is the thing working correctly. The same shape arriving at `/gate/decide` is
 * the agent answering its own question: it runs as this user, so it can read
 * `~/.config/agentglass/token`, or find `AGENTGLASS_TOKEN` in the environment
 * it was launched with, and one `curl` later `actorOf` writes `local` into the
 * audit row — byte for byte what the desk's own button writes — and gate.ts
 * tells the model a human reviewed the call.
 *
 * So this asks for something the held party has no way to produce:
 *
 *   * a **paired device** with the `answer` grant. Its credential was minted at
 *     the desk, lives on that phone, is stored here only as a hash and is never
 *     in any environment an agent inherits (auth.ts, devices.ts).
 *   * or, where the desktop app started this server, **the app's key**
 *     (desk.ts): minted for each sidecar, handed down a pipe to this process
 *     and through the preload to the renderer, in no file, environment or argv
 *     an agent can read. A server the app adopted instead holds the key the app
 *     claimed for it, while the app holds the claim (desk.ts, and its ceiling). There an Origin opens nothing. It used to, and a header
 *     is a string: `curl -H "Origin: agentglass://app"` with the machine token
 *     released the agent's own call, for the helpful agent that reads "approve
 *     it" as the next step and for the one an injected instruction sends alike.
 *     The device store above it is read once, at start, for the same reason:
 *     a row planted in devices.json afterwards is not a device (devices.ts).
 *   * or, on a server started by hand and not claimed, an **Origin** this
 *     server vouches for. There is no key, and the client a person uses
 *     there without pairing first is a browser, which attaches `Origin` to
 *     every POST and cannot hold a secret an agent on the same machine could
 *     not read as well. That keeps the obvious `curl` out and lets a deliberate
 *     forgery through: the limit SECURITY.md states for a hand-started server.
 *
 * And the case that is easy to read past: with no token configured at all,
 * `caller` is always null — `resolveToken` returns none on a loopback-only box
 * and index.ts never runs the block that identifies anybody — so the device
 * branch does not exist there and the Origin branch is the whole of this check.
 * It still turns away the Origin-less `curl`, which is the shape this is about,
 * but on such a box nothing else is authenticated either: any local process can
 * post a gate and read the queue. That is `bun run dev` and any hand-started
 * server, never the packaged app, which mints a secret for its own sidecar. If
 * it is you, set `AGENTGLASS_TOKEN` — see resolveToken in auth.ts.

 * A ping is answered by the peer's own websocket stack, so a pong is evidence
 * that its process is being scheduled — which is exactly the thing a frozen
 * phone stops doing while its TCP connection carries on accepting bytes.
 *
 * The CLOSE is not optional, and that is the part reading the code would not
 * have found. Bun's own reaper does close a silent socket — measured at 120.1s
 * with this serve config — but it counts a ping as traffic: with a 10s ping and
 * no close of our own, the SIGSTOPped peer was still attached at 200s and
 * climbing, so adding liveness detection without acting on it turns a
 * two-minute leak into a permanent one. Closing on the deadline is what makes
 * the ping safe to send at all.
 *
 * 10s and 30s: three missed pongs before a socket stops counting. The cost of
 * being too eager is one duplicate notification (broadcast AND notify-send)
 * for a client that was merely slow; the cost of being too slow is an alert
 * nobody hears. Freshly opened sockets start alive, so the first alert after a
 * connect is never a false negative.
 *
 * A `pty` socket was exempt from all of this, and that is what let a phone's
 * mirror outlive the phone: `new-session ... destroy-unattached on` only ever
 * fires on OUR side once the pty this socket feeds is hung up (`ptyClose` ->
 * `killGroup` -> the child that was running `tmux attach` dies -> tmux sees
 * the detach). A phone that goes dark — backgrounded, out of signal — never
 * sends a close frame, so that chain never starts, and the grouped session
 * with it sits on the socket for as long as the TCP connection is willing to
 * pretend it is still open. Same ping, same deadline, same `alive` map a pty
 * socket already gets entries in (the `pong` handler below sets one for every
 * kind) — it was just never read for anything.

     * The three reads, and why they do NOT get the gate `/gate/decide` just got.
     *
     * The case for giving it to them is real. `/gate/pending` hands back the
     * command an agent is stopped on, and `/gate/history` hands back every
     * command it was stopped on this month plus who decided each one. That is a
     * description of what this user does with their machine, and today it is
     * readable by anything on the box holding the token — the same shell that
     * was just refused the button next to it. Locking a decision while leaving
     * the queue open is half a door.
     *
     * It is still the wrong trade, for a reason that is specific rather than
     * philosophical: `hooks/gate_event.py` polls `/gate/status` to re-attach
     * after a dropped connection, and it is Python `urllib` — it sends no
     * Origin and there is no sensible way to make it send one. A 403 there is
     * not caught as a refusal; the retry loop treats a non-404 error as "the
     * connection went away, keep trying" until its own deadline passes, and
     * then falls into fail-open. Every held call on the box would auto-allow,
     * silently, with the hold looking healthy on screen. That is strictly worse
     * than the bug being fixed here — it converts the gate from "an agent can
     * release itself if it tries" into "no agent is ever held".
     *
     * And the disclosure the other two carry is bounded in a way the release is
     * not. A process that can read `/gate/pending` runs as this user, which
     * means it can already read the transcripts, the events database and the
     * repositories those commands are about. Reading the queue tells it what it
     * could have learned anyway; answering the queue lets it do something it
     * could not. So: reads stay on the surface-wide origin gate plus the token,
     * writes carry the stricter one. If `/gate/pending` and `/gate/history` are
     * ever tightened, `/gate/status` must be left exactly as it is, and the
     * reason is this paragraph rather than an oversight.

// left running inside a worktree that was later deleted (cwd `(deleted)`). The

// handler, which likewise cannot survive its own SIGKILL. The observed result:
// a dozen servers reparented to init, each holding a port and a fistful of
// shells, still running ~18h later and saturating the box. This gives the
// server its own defence — it remembers the pid it was born under and, every
// few seconds, checks that pid is still both its parent and alive. Reparented
// to init (ppid 1), handed to a different parent, or the original gone → hang
// up the shells and exit under its own power, within ~3s of losing its parent.
