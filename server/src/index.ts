// only other thing that stops a sidecar is Electron's in-process stopSidecar
// handler, which likewise cannot survive its own SIGKILL. The observed result:
// a dozen servers reparented to init, each holding a port and a fistful of
// shells, still running ~18h later and saturating the box. This gives the
// server its own defence — it remembers the pid it was born under and, every
// few seconds, checks that pid is still both its parent and alive. Reparented
// to init (ppid 1), handed to a different parent, or the original gone → hang
// up the shells and exit under its own power, within ~3s of losing its parent.
//
// Gated behind a flag the launcher opts into, so a deliberately daemonized
// `make start` is never self-terminated. Every launcher that expects the
// server to die with it sets the flag (the electron spawn, the dev script, the
// perf/soak spawns); the 432-test suite never sets it, so the watchdog stays
// dormant under `make test` — which is why the interval is not even registered
// unless the flag is present. `process.ppid === 1` is the robust signal: a
// crash of an intermediate wrapper (`bun --watch`, `concurrently`) reparents
// the whole subtree to init, which a bare `!== bornUnder` on a still-live
// wrapper would miss; `!== bornUnder` in turn catches the immediate parent
// alone going away and the pid being recycled under a new owner.
