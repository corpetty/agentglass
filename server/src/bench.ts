/*
 * The floating bench's own state: its notes, and what of it is still running.
 *
 * The tabs themselves need nothing here — each is a tmux session on the engine
 * (see engineBenchArgv), which is what makes them survive the window, the app
 * and the reboot. Two things do not fit in a tmux session, and they are what
 * this file is:
 *
 *   the note      "what I just found out about this branch". It belongs to a
 *                 CHECKOUT and to nothing else.
 *   what is live  which bench sessions this checkout still has, so the window
 *                 can say "3 open" about a worktree you are not looking at
 *                 rather than quietly losing them.
 *
 * On where a note is kept, because the obvious answer is wrong: NOT a file in
 * the checkout. An untracked file in somebody's repository turns up in their
 * status, in `git add -A`, and eventually in a commit nobody meant to make —
 * this app has already been bitten by notes-in-the-repo once and the rule that
 * came out of it was "work notes live outside the repository". So it goes in
 * the app's own data directory, keyed by the checkout's path.

/**
 * The two commands that put a file in front of you, and why it is two.
 *
 * It was one: a single `--remote-send` typing `<Cmd>e <path><CR>` and the rest
 * into the running editor. The path was escaped for spaces and nothing else,
 * and an `:e` argument is a command line: backticks in it run a shell, `|`
 * ends the command and starts the next. Measured on a private headless nvim
 * (0.11, `--clean`): opening a file named x`touch probe`.md through that
 * string created `probe` in the editor's working directory and left the
 * buffer called `x.md`; opening x|!cmd.md left the buffer called `x` with the
 * rest handed to `:!`. Every file the bench may open is one the checkout or a
 * pull request put on disk, so the name is the attacker's.
 *
 * So the path never enters a keystroke string again. It goes to `--remote`,
 * where it is ONE ARGV ELEMENT: nvim receives it as a string, runs
 * `fnameescape()` on it itself and hands the result to `:drop`, which reuses
 * the buffer if it is already open — the same thing `:e` was here for. The
 * argv route cannot be escaped wrongly because nothing here escapes it.
 *
 * What `--remote` cannot do is the rest: the line, and the read-only flag for
 * a copy of a commit. Those still go by `--remote-send`, in a SECOND call that
 * carries no caller-controlled text at all — a number and two option names.
 * Two round trips on a local socket, measured, are not visible; one keystroke
 * string with a filename in it is a hole.
 *
 * `<Cmd>` rather than `:`, measured on screen: a colon command is echoed and
 * the last one sits in the command line under the file you came to read —
 * ":setl noreadonly modifiable" is not a thing anybody asked to be told.
 * `zt` puts the line at the TOP of the window rather than wherever it landed,
 * the same jump the pane rail sends.
 *
 * Exported so the test can hold the argv up to the light rather than needing
 * an editor: the property is "the path is its own argv element and appears in
 * no `--remote-send` string", and that is true or false of the arrays.
