/*
 * NAMED AGENTS ON THE ENGINE — the launcher and the liveness a script needs
 * to run unattended agents on this machine without a second orchestrator.
 *
 * An unattended worker script — one that picks a task on a clock, cuts a
 * worktree and seats an agent in it — leans on an orchestrator like Herdr in
 * exactly six places, all of them one shape: start an agent by NAME
 * in a checkout, hand it a prompt, wait until it is working, read its screen,
 * press a key, and — on the next tick — list the names still alive so a card
 * whose agent vanished can be reconciled. Nothing else. So this is that
 * surface and no more: a registry of named agents, each a window on the tmux
 * engine this app already owns, with the same verbs and the same answer shape
 * (`{ result: { agents: [{ name }] } }`) so such a script reads it with a
 * one-word change on its side.
 *
 * What it deliberately is NOT: a scheduler. It picks no card, opens no
 * worktree, decides nothing about what to work on — the script does all of
 * that on its own side, where its ledger and its locks already live.
 * This app is the launcher and the liveness, which is the part Herdr was.
 *
 * Liveness is a FACT, not a claim: an agent is alive while its pane exists on
 * the engine. The window runs the CLI as its command, so the CLI exiting takes
 * the window with it, and a name whose pane is gone is gone — no heartbeat to
 * miss, no timeout to tune. The readiness and busy signals come off the pane's
 * screen through the same readers the chat and the clone use (`inputBox`,
 * `__submitVerdict`), so the four surfaces cannot disagree about what a Claude
 * prompt looks like.
