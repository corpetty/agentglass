// Serve the built dashboard (web/dist) from the API port, when a build exists.
//
// This is what lets a headless install run ONE process: `bun run build` once,
// then the server owns both the API and the UI on a single port — no vite
// preview alongside it, no second unit to keep alive. The desktop shell already
// proved the arrangement (it hosts web/dist over loopback HTTP itself); this
// gives the same thing to server-only deploys. When web/dist is absent —
// dev, or a hooks-only install that never built the UI — every route behaves
// exactly as before.
//
// Two rules keep it from treading on the API:
//   * exact files only, resolved traversal-safe under web/dist — an API path
//     matches no file there, so it falls through to the routes untouched;
//   * the SPA fallback runs LAST, after every API route has declined, and only
//     for a GET that asks for html — curl on a bad path still gets the JSON 404.
//
// index.html is served with a planted marker (see injectSameOrigin) telling the
// bundle it came from the API's own origin, so the web app can point its calls
// at location.origin instead of assuming :4000 — that is the whole contract
// between this file and web/src/lib/api.ts.

 * `/$bunfs/root`, a virtual filesystem holding the bundled script and nothing
 * else, so `../../web/dist` resolves to a path that has never existed and the
 * sidecar reports no UI however the app was installed. The bundle *is* there —
 * electron-builder copies web/dist to `resources/web` — and the shell knows
 * exactly where, so it passes the path in. That is what lets the desktop app
 * hand a phone on the LAN a dashboard instead of a JSON API.
 *
 * An override naming a directory with no index.html is ignored rather than
 * fatal: a wrong path should cost the UI, not the server behind it.
