// The mechanism docs/PLUGINS.md describes, and only that mechanism:
// install copies a folder, review shows what its manifest declares in the
// same words `auth.ts` already uses for `read`/`answer`/`full`, nothing runs
// until a human enables that specific plugin, and enabling mints a scoped
// token and spawns the entrypoint as a SEPARATE PROCESS talking HTTP — the
// exact shape EXTENDING.md documents for a hand-written extension, now
// installable by someone who did not write it.
//
// Drawing is a separate module: a plugin may declare panels, a settings page
// and notes on pull requests in its manifest (`contributes`), and send what to
// show as data. plugin-ui.ts keeps it and the window draws it with its own
// components, so no plugin code ever runs in the window — see "Drawing in the
// app" in docs/PLUGINS.md. Declaring is part of what gets reviewed: the
// contributions are in `manifestHash`, so a plugin that starts drawing
// somewhere new asks again.
