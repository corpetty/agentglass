// The probes themselves are not new: git, docker, gh, tmux and the notification
// bus each had a capability endpoint already, because each panel needs its own
// answer to render. What did not exist was the sum of them, and the three that
// nothing ever reported at all: python3, setsid and `script`. Those three are
// the ones that fail quietly, which is exactly why they belong on a list. A
// missing python3 leaves the hooks installed and dead (nothing streams, nothing
// says why) and drops the terminal into a mode where full-screen programs do
// not render; a missing setsid leaves stray processes behind a closed shell.
//
// Read-only throughout: this route probes and reports, it never installs.
