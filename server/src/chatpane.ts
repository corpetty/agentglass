// The tmux-pane chat engine.
//
// The other engine (chat.ts) spawns `claude -p` per turn and streams its stdout.
// That is simple and stateless, and it pays for both: every turn re-initialises
// the whole session, which on a machine with MCP servers wired up measured 2.9-3.8s
// before the model said a word. This engine keeps one interactive `claude` alive
// in a tmux pane per chat, so that cost is paid once. Measured on the same
// prompt, model and directory: 2927/3766/3541ms via `-p`, 1354/1218/1431ms here.
//
// It does NOT read the screen to build the conversation. Claude Code writes a
// structured JSONL transcript for every session, which is the same source the
// dashboard already hydrates historical sessions from; the pane is where the
// process lives, the transcript is what it said. Screen scraping is used for
// exactly one thing — deciding the TUI has finished drawing its input box — and
// nothing about the conversation depends on it.
//
// The payoff beyond latency: the session is a real tmux session, so
// `tmux -L agentglass attach -t <id>` drops the user into the very chat they
// were reading in the app and lets them keep typing. That is not something the
// `-p` engine can ever offer.
