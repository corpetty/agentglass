//
// 1. NEVER on the poll path. A `gh` call costs 0.8-1.9s and this server has one
//    thread. The panel polls; the fetches do not. Every read below answers from
//    a cache and refreshes behind it, so a poll is a map lookup.
//
// 2. Keyed by the repo on the forge, not by the directory. Eighteen worktrees
//    of one clone are one repo — keying by path would fetch the same list
//    eighteen times.
//
// 3. Writes are public. A stray `gh pr merge` is not a UI bug, it is a deploy,
//    so every mutation goes through `writeGuard` and the irreversible ones are
//    named separately from the rest.
