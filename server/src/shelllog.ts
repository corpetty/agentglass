/**
 * A shell command, filed as telemetry rather than as a wall of text.
 *
 * The cockpit's PTY was the one place work happened that produced nothing
 * measurable. Everything an agent does through Claude Code lands in `events`
 * and is charted, searched, and counted; everything it did in the shell was
 * scrollback.
 *
 * So a command goes into the same table, in the same shape. That is not a
 * shortcut — it is what the issue asks for, and it is what makes the feature
 * worth more than the sum of its parts: the live feed shows shell commands
 * beside tool calls, the latency pane ranks `bun test` against `Read`, search
 * finds the `git push` that failed last Tuesday, and the retention rollup keeps
 * it all for exactly as long as it keeps everything else. None of that had to
 * be built.
 *
 * `PostToolUse` / `PostToolUseFailure` are deliberately the event types. A
 * command is a tool call: it has a name, a duration, and it either worked or it
 * did not. Inventing a fourth kind of event would have left it out of every
 * pane that already answers those questions.
