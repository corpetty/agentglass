/*
 * The part of a task list that is ours: when to tell somebody.
 *
 * Taskwarrior has nowhere to put a reminder, and — measured — loses 21 of 25
 * concurrent writes, so it is the wrong place to keep the one thing that must
 * not be lost. This lives in agentglass's own database, which agentglass alone
 * writes. The consequence is the point: reminders keep working when Taskwarrior
 * is missing, unconfigured, or in the middle of being edited from Neovim.
 *
 * There is no `arm()` and no `setTimeout`. A tick claims what is due in one
 * transactional statement and delivers what it claimed. That single decision
 * removes, at once: the boot storm (restore is just the first tick), the
 * cancelled-reminder-fires-anyway bug (cancellation is in the claim predicate),
 * the timer-and-sweep double claim (there is one claimer), the suspend gap (a
 * laptop that slept through 09:00 fires at 09:03 rather than never), and the
 * bookkeeping of a scheduling horizon.
