/*
 * The commands you saved, as opposed to the commands we found.
 *
 * `terminal.ts` already answers "what can I run in this repo" by walking its
 * Makefiles and package.json — 322 entries on a real checkout, and every one of
 * them a single line with no arguments. That list DISCOVERS; it cannot
 * remember. So the three-step thing you worked out yesterday, with the one
 * value that changes each time, has nowhere to live and ends up as a shell
 * function outside the app.
 *
 * This is where it lives instead. Kept beside config.json in a file a person
 * can read and edit, for the same reason clickup-views.json is: it is a handful
 * of short strings, it is not a secret, and being able to open it in an editor
 * is worth more than any storage engine.
 *
 * The whole file is written with one thing in mind: a recipe is text that
 * becomes a process with the user's permissions. Everything below that looks
 * like paranoia is that.
