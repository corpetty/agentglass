// chosen repo/worktree and streams its JSONL straight back for the web panel to
// parse. `codex exec --json` is Codex's equivalent of

// arrives in the `thread.started` frame) and follow-ups go through
// `codex exec resume <thread_id>`.

// Frames are passed through untranslated, exactly as chat.ts passes Claude's
// through. Codex speaks a different vocabulary — `item.completed` with a typed
// item rather than Anthropic content blocks — and translating it here would put
// half a parser on the server and half in the browser. The whole translation
// lives in web/src/lib/codexFrames.ts instead, so there is one place to look
// when a frame renders wrong.
