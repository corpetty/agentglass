/**
 * Talking to the tmux session running inside a panel's shell.
 *
 * The panel used to do the opposite of this: detect tmux and stand down, on the
 * grounds that tmux owns the tabs. It does own them, and that left the one strip
 * of the workspace we do not control being drawn by whatever `.tmux.conf` the
 * machine happens to carry — the same user, on two laptops, gets two different
 * looking window lists pasted across an otherwise coherent panel.
 *
 * So: we draw, tmux decides. Everything here either asks tmux what it has or
 * asks it to do something a keybinding could already have done. No state is kept
 * about which window is active, no input is intercepted, and every keybinding
 * behaves exactly as it did before, because the shell still receives every byte.
 * A click on a tab is `select-window` and nothing more.
 *
 * Linux-only, like the detection it grew out of: it reads /proc to find the tmux
 * client and the terminal it is attached to. Anywhere else this reports nothing
 * and the panel keeps its own chrome, which is the correct fallback rather than
 * a degraded one.

 * directory in a `catch {}` and exports the path either way, so a single failed
 * mkdir — a stale root-owned /tmp/agx-test-tmux, a full disk, someone's cleanup
 * script — hands every spawned child exactly this. Asking the filesystem

 * bare invocation cannot be aimed at a stand-in: `-S` and `-L` are the only two

 * be refused would therefore be aimed at the developer's own server, and would
 * hit it on the one run the guard was missing — which is the run the test
 * exists for. So the refusal is asserted here, where asserting it costs
 * nothing, and the behavioural half of the test only ever drives `-S <stand-in>`.
 *
 * THREE refusals, because there are three ways for this process to be next to
 * his tmux and each version of this guard has known one more than the last:
 *
 *   1. `$TMUX`, ALWAYS — a private TMUX_TMPDIR does not buy it back. Agents in
 *      this repo run inside his tmux, so `bun test` inherits a `$TMUX` naming
 *      his socket, and a bare command goes there whatever TMUX_TMPDIR says.
 *      Nothing in this repo ever sets `$TMUX`: the four suites that run a
 *      server of their own name it with `-L agx-…`, which is checked first and
 *      is not this. So "the socket $TMUX names" is a precise spelling of "his",
 *      not a heuristic.
 *
 *   2. `/tmp/tmux-<uid>/default`, ALWAYS — the machine's real socket, refused
 *      as a constant rather than inferred. This is the one that was missing,
 *      and its absence is what made the other two conditional on a model.
 *      Every earlier version asked "is the socket about to be used the same as
 *      the one `socketDir()` predicts", so a `socketDir()` that predicted the
 *      wrong directory unlocked the right one. Two ways that happened: a

/**
 * Is this socket inside the private socket directory this process was given?
 *
 * A DIFFERENT question from `tmuxSocketAllowed`, and the reason it exists is
 * that it is not gated on NODE_ENV. Measured on Bun 1.3.9, `bun test` puts
 * NODE_ENV=test in the test process and it does NOT reach a child spawned with
 * a named environment — which is how nearly every suite here starts the server.
 * To every `process.env.NODE_ENV` check in this repo, such a child is
 * indistinguishable from production, so no amount of NODE_ENV guarding reaches
 * it.
 *
 * TMUX_TMPDIR is the one signal that does survive that spawn — the lint at the
 * bottom of `tmux-test-isolation.test.ts` fails the build if a suite spawns the
 * server without one — so it is the only thing a rule for that child can be
 * built on. The rule: a process handed a private socket directory may act on
 * servers INSIDE it and nowhere else. `/tmp/tmux-1000/default` is not inside
 * `/tmp/agx-test-tmux`.
 *
 * Free in production, checked: nothing in `server/src` or `desktop/` sets
 * TMUX_TMPDIR, so a real user's process is unconfined and this answers true —
 * and a user who does set one keeps their server inside it, so it answers true
 * for them too. It only ever refuses a process that was confined and then
 * reached outside its confinement.
 *
 * Applied at the two spawns in `themesync.ts` AND inside `tmux()` — the second
 * of those was the "obvious next change" this note used to defer, and what
 * made it due was finding the same reach through a door no NODE_ENV guard can
 * see: six scripts in `scripts/` spawn `server/src/index.ts`, none under `bun
 * test`, and every tmux command that server runs — the boot sweep, and
 * `listPanes` on every `/panes` request — resolved against `/tmp/tmux-<uid>`.
 * With those scripts now naming a private TMUX_TMPDIR (`scripts/tmuxTmp.ts`),
 * this is what makes that naming binding on all of them at once instead of on
 * the one call site somebody remembered.

 * Move a phone's pane through its own scrollback, in tmux's copy mode.

 * turned into wheel events and handed to xterm, and xterm's answer to a wheel on
 * the alternate screen with no scrollback of its own is a cursor key: measured
 * through the shipped page against a pane running `cat -v`, one drag delivered
 * 53 of them and the screen moved a single line. Arrows walk history onto a
 * prompt, and in an agent's TUI they move whatever is selected — including the
 * two buttons on a permission gate. Nothing on the phone can encode a scroll
 * safely, because a terminal has no way to say "scroll" that is not a key or a
 * mouse report. tmux does, and this is it.
 *
 * ── what it costs, said plainly ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * Copy mode is a property of the PANE, not of a client, so the desk sees it too
 * — and that is not a new cost this introduces. It is exactly what tmux itself
 * does when it has the mouse: `WheelUpPane` is bound to `copy-mode -e` followed
 * by the wheel, and with `mouse on` a phone drag already put the shared pane
 * into copy mode at scroll_position 33 (measured, same rig). The difference is
 * only which side asks for it.
 *
 * `-e` is what makes it clean up after itself: scrolling back down to the
 * bottom LEAVES copy mode. Measured on 3.6a — `send-keys -X -N 200 scroll-down`
 * against a pane 85 lines up ended with pane_in_mode 0 — so the ordinary way out
 * of a scroll is also the way out of the mode, with nothing to remember.
 *
 * The pane is the one the phone's own client is looking at, asked of tmux rather
 * than remembered from the attach: `windowId` on PhoneAttach is documented as
 * routing and not truth, and a phone can walk to another window with tmux's own
 * keys. The session name is ours and is checked against the one pattern this app
 * ever creates, so this can only ever address a window a phone of ours is on.
 *

 * the caller can hand the mode back if it was this that started it — and null

 * vertical space to spare. `status` is a session option, so turning it off on
 * the session named here costs nobody else anything — measured with two real
 * ptys against a grouped pair, the desk's client went on painting its bar (its
 * session name and its clock kept arriving on its pty after the phone attached,
 * and its session still reports no `status` of its own, so it is still reading
 * the user's global value) while the phone's pty carried neither. Without the
 * option the phone painted the bar, which is the control that says it is this
 * line doing the work. The desk's bar is the user's own configuration and is
 * not ours to switch off.

/*
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE PIN LEDGER: which tmux servers this installation has ever pinned on.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN ANOTHER ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE. The boot sweep
 * used to be handed `tmuxSockets()` — a listing of `$TMUX_TMPDIR/tmux-<uid>`,
 * which with TMUX_TMPDIR unset is `/tmp/tmux-<uid>`, this developer's own
 * sockets — and the only thing standing in front of it was
 * `blindTmuxBanned()`, whose first line is `if (process.env.NODE_ENV !==
 * "test") return false`. A server that is not under `bun test` was therefore
 * not guarded at all, and six scripts in `scripts/` spawn exactly that server:
 * soak, loadtest, perfbudget, capture-live, conflict-drive, browser-drive.
 * Each one carefully redirects AGENTGLASS_DB, XDG_CONFIG_HOME, XDG_DATA_HOME
 * and XDG_CACHE_HOME, and none of them set NODE_ENV or TMUX_TMPDIR. Measured
 * with the exact environment `perfbudget.ts` hands its child, `$TMUX` cleared:
 *
 *   NODE_ENV = undefined   TMUX_TMPDIR = undefined
 *   socketPath([])  /tmp/tmux-1000/default
 *   allowed([])     true
 *   tmuxSockets()   25 sockets, his default among them
 *
 * That is the THIRD time this same reach has been closed, each time through a
 * door the previous fix did not know about: a guard for `bun test`, then a lint
 * over `server/test` and `mobile/test`, and now a population — files that spawn
 * the server — that neither of those had a name for. Giving those six scripts a
 * TMUX_TMPDIR (done, `scripts/tmuxTmp.ts`) is the same shape as both previous
 * fixes: it protects the six that exist and nothing about the seventh.
 *
 * So the default is inverted. The sweep no longer asks "is there a reason to
 * refuse"; it asks the process to DEMONSTRATE the socket is one it owns, and
 * touches nothing it cannot prove. NODE_ENV is not consulted, so this holds for
 * a script's server, a `bun run` in a checkout, CI, and an Electron sidecar
 * alike.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS PROOF. The sweep exists to undo `window-size manual` that a
 * previous run of THIS INSTALLATION left on a window and was SIGKILLed before
 * releasing. There is exactly one line in this file that writes the
 * `@agx-had-size` mark such a run leaves — the `set-option` in
 * `windowSizeOptions` — so "sockets we could have marked" is a set this app can
 * write down at the instant it marks one, and read back at the next boot. It
 * lives beside the database and the settings, under $XDG_DATA_HOME, because
 * that is where this app's identity already is.
 *
 * WHAT IT COVERS: any launcher whose data directory is not this installation's
 * — which is all six scripts (they redirect XDG_DATA_HOME today), every test
 * that redirects it, CI, and a fresh checkout — sweeps NOTHING, whatever it
 * does with NODE_ENV or TMUX_TMPDIR, because its ledger is empty. A boot that
 * has never pinned anything issues zero tmux commands, so it never even lists
 * his socket directory.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, plainly: a launcher that redirects nothing at all.
 * Such a process reads this installation's ledger and would perform this
 * installation's own recovery — the same windows the app itself would release
 * at its next boot, never a stranger's socket. That residue is irreducible: a
 * process holding the app's database, settings and data directory is the app by
 * every signal that exists. What changed is the blast radius — from "every tmux
 * server on the machine" to "the servers this install has pinned on".
 *
 * AND THE ONE THING IT COSTS: a window pinned by a build from BEFORE this
 * ledger existed, orphaned by a SIGKILL, is never released — there is no entry
 * for it and no way to invent one. One upgrade boundary, for the windows
 * orphaned across it; `fit` and `takeover` still clear their own marks, and
 * everything pinned after the upgrade is recorded.

 * WITH THE SOCKETS IT NAMES, whenever a socket directory has been named at all;
 * otherwise beside the database (`db.ts`) and the browsing history
 * (`placestore.ts`), under the XDG_DATA_HOME they read.
 *
 * The first rule is not a test convenience, and the first full suite run after
 * this ledger was written is why it exists. It put a fixture socket into the
 * developer's real `~/.local/share/agentglass/pinned-tmux-sockets`:
 *
 *   /tmp/agx-tmux-claim-1440175/tmux-1000/agx-claim
 *
 * `tmux-attach-claim.test.ts` drives `attachArgvFor`, which pins a window,
 * which writes here. That file is correctly isolated — private TMUX_TMPDIR,
 * `-f /dev/null`, its own socket name — and it still wrote into his data
 * directory, because nothing in tmuxctl.ts had ever written there before and no
 * test had reason to redirect XDG_DATA_HOME. Every other suite that pins is the
 * same shape, and so is every launcher: `tmux-sigkill-restore` hands its server
 * child TMUX_TMPDIR and XDG_CONFIG_HOME and no XDG_DATA_HOME. Requiring a
 * second variable would be the third round of "protect the callers that exist".
 *
 * So the record follows the thing it is a record OF. A process handed a private
 * TMUX_TMPDIR has a private tmux world, its pins are about servers in that
 * directory, and they are meaningless to any other. It also fixes the lifetime:
 * a fixture's entries die with `rmSync(TMPDIR)` instead of outliving the sockets
 * they name by months. And it holds for a real user who exports TMUX_TMPDIR —
 * the file sits beside their sockets and persists exactly as long as those do,
 * so their boot sweep goes on working across restarts.
 *
 * `$TMUX_TMPDIR/agentglass-pinned-sockets`, and NOT inside `tmux-<uid>/` one
 * level down: `tmuxSockets()` maps every entry of that directory to a socket,
 * so a file in there would be handed to the sweep as a server to walk.
 *
 * The NODE_ENV floor underneath is for the case neither covers — a test that
 * pins with no TMUX_TMPDIR at all. `tmuxSocketAllowed` refuses those before
 * they reach a real server, so it is belt and braces; it costs one string
 * compare and it means no arrangement of variables writes a test's pins into
 * the file a real boot reads.

 * enumerates the windows (free — the format string carries it) and is never
 * overwritten. Two phones on one window: the second one's capture is the
 * `manual` the FIRST one's fit already wrote, so overwriting would record our
 * own footprint as the way back and pin the window exactly as the original bug
 * did. It is the same rule the shutdown path spends its `seq` ordering on —

   * grid. Measured on the emulator against a 44-column client: with no zoom the
   * phone's own screen carried the first line of all four panes (PANE-A/B/C/D
   * markers, every one of them), whichever pane had been tapped. Four
   * destinations, one destination. And each of them a quarter of an already
   * narrow screen — about 40 columns, where prose breaks every three words.
   * With the zoom the same client carried the tapped pane's marker and no other.
   *
   * ON, and not a switch, and that is a decision rather than an omission. A
   * switch would have to be asked for by the phone, and this server does not
   * own the phone's code — so an off-by-default zoom is a feature nothing can
   * turn on. It is also not a choice the person tapping a pane has any way to
   * make: they tapped ONE pane, which is the request.
   *
   * The cost is real and is the same cost the fit has: zoom is a window flag
   * and a grouped session shares the window, so the desk sees it, and it does
   * not undo itself when the phone goes (measured: a window left zoomed by a
   * killed phone still reports the flag two seconds later). Both halves are
   * answered the way the fit answers them — a notice with a way out on the desk
   * (see `takeover` and the row in TerminalPanel) and a restore on the way out
   * (see `restoreWindows`).
   *
   * Not a window the desk has just taken back. Take-over unzooms, and the phone
   * is told so and remounts with `fit` off — which comes straight back through
   * here. Without this the desk's click would be undone within the second by
   * the reconnection it caused. A deliberate fit releases the claim first (the
   * line above), so the phone asking again does get its zoom back.
   *
   * "Already zoomed" is NOT a reason to stand down, and reading it as one is
   * the bug the emulator found: tapping the second tab of the same window
   * opened it with the window already zoomed by the first tab, so this sent
   * nothing — and the tab showed the 2x2 grid again, which is the whole defect
   * back for every tab but the first.
   *
   * The command sequence handles it, and only measurement says so (tmux 3.6a,
   * a three-pane window):
   *
   *   resize-pane -Z -t A            z=1  active=A
   *   select-pane  -t B              z=0  active=B   <- selecting UNZOOMS
   *   resize-pane -Z -t B            z=1  active=B
   *   ... and -Z -t B with no select first: z=0, active still A — the toggle
   *       applies to the WINDOW, so it takes the other pane's zoom off instead
   *
   * The `select-pane` above already runs before the zoom, so a window zoomed
   * onto somebody else's pane is unzoomed by it and re-zoomed onto ours. The
   * one case that must send nothing is a window already zoomed onto OUR pane —
   * a reconnect, or the same tab twice — where `select-pane` keeps the zoom
   * (measured) and a `resize-pane -Z` would take it off. It is still owed back:
   * whoever zoomed it has had its teardown skipped for as long as we are here.
   *
   * What is NOT restored is a zoom the desk had on a DIFFERENT pane: it is
   * unzoomed rather than put back, because tmux offers no way to tell a phone's
   * zoom from a person's, and showing the phone a pane it did not open is the
   * thing this exists to stop. The notice on the desk says the phone did it and

 *
 * Measured on a private server (tmux 3.6a, `-f /dev/null`, a fitted phone on a
 * two-pane window): `kill-session` returns 0 and the very next `list-sessions`
 * — the same call `phoneWindows` makes — no longer lists it. The window is not

 * the session is what makes the restore ALLOWED, not what performs it.
 *
 * Only ever a name this app itself created, and that guard is why this is a
 * function rather than an inlined call: `kill-session` is the most destructive

/**
 * Put the group's windows back the way the phone found them.
 *
 * `window-size latest` — what `fit` sets — is read per WINDOW, and a grouped
 * session shares every window in the group, not just the one being looked at.
 * Measured on a live desk while a phone was attached to one pane of a
 * five-window session: the four windows the desk was NOT on had all been pulled
 * down to the phone's 80 columns, and the fifth had been squeezed and let go
 * again, leaving the program inside it drawn at 80 in a 277-column pane. That
 * is the screenshot this exists because of.
 *
 * Changing the option back is not enough on its own — also measured. tmux
 * applies `window-size` when something makes it recompute, so a window already
 * squeezed stays squeezed until asked. `resize-window -A` is that ask.
 *
 * And `-A` is not enough either, which is the bug this function shipped with.
 * `resize-window` SETS `window-size manual` on the window it resizes — the
 * manpage says so and a private server confirms it — so the version of this
 * that ran `-A` and stopped left every window of the user's session pinned:
 *
 *   phone fitted                          80x24  window-size=manual
 *   `-A` on the way out                  200x49  window-size=manual
 *   desk then resizes its terminal 160x45 200x49  window-size=manual
 *
 * One phone visit and the user's own terminal stopped reflowing their tmux, on
 * every window in the session, permanently, with nothing on screen to say why.
 * So the option goes back too — AFTER the `-A`, because the `-A` is what sets
 * it, and doing them the other way round writes `manual` over the restore.
 *
 * `hadWindowSize` is what each window carried before the phone's command ran
 * (see `windowSizeOptions`); an empty string means the window had none of its
 * own and the restore is an unset. Only those windows are touched: they are the
 * ones that existed when the phone arrived, and `-A`ing a window we have no
 * record of would cost it its `window-size` to fix a squeeze it never had.
 *
 * Called on the way out rather than trusted to happen: our session dies with
 * the client (`destroy-unattached on`), and a window whose only small client
 * has gone still holds the small size until somebody recomputes it.
 *
 * The zoom is the second thing owed back and the reason this is no longer
 * called `restoreWindowSizes`. A zoom is not a size — it is a window flag, it
 * belongs to the shared window exactly as `window-size` does, and it outlives
 * the phone in exactly the same way: measured on a private server, a window a
 * phone zoomed still reports `window_zoomed_flag` 1 with the phone's client
 * killed and its session gone. `zoomed` names the one window this attach is
 * responsible for and the pane it is zoomed onto, so nothing else is touched.

 * THE HOLE THIS FILLS. `restoreWindows` is correct and is reached from three
 * places: the socket closing, `cleanup`'s two timers, and `shutdownTerminals`
 * on SIGINT/SIGTERM. Every one of them is code running inside the server. A
 * SIGKILL, an OOM kill, or the machine going down runs none of it, and the
 * `window-size manual` that a phone's fit writes onto the DESK'S window then
 * lasts as long as that tmux server does.
 *
 * It is not theoretical. Reported with a screenshot after the app had been
 * killed hard several times in one day — one window of a five-window session
 * stuck with a gap along the bottom:
 *
 *   work:2  agent-a  267x59  window-size=latest
 *   work:3  agent-b  267x59  window-size=latest
 *   work:4  agent-c  267x59  window-size=latest
 *   work:5  agent-d  277x54  window-size=manual   <- the only one
 *   work:6  agent-e  267x59  window-size=latest
 *
 * 54 rows against a 59-row client: those five rows ARE the gap. The window had
 * stopped following the terminal it was drawn in, permanently, and nothing
 * anywhere pointed at the app that had done it.
 *
 * WHAT PROVES A SERVER IS OURS TO WALK, asked before any of what follows and
 * answered without consulting NODE_ENV: the pin ledger, which this installation
 * writes at the instant it takes a window's size. No record, no walk — not even
 * a `list-windows`. That is what stops a server spawned by `make soak`, `make
 * perf` or `make loadtest` from reaching the developer's own sockets, and it is
 * the level the two previous fixes for this (a `bun test` guard, then a lint
 * over the test roots) were both aimed below. See THE PIN LEDGER above for what
 * it covers and what it does not.
 *
 * WHAT PROVES A WINDOW IS OURS, since the alternative is undoing somebody's own
 * setting. Only the `@agx-had-size` mark, written in `windowSizeOptions` at the
 * moment of capture and nowhere else. tmux neither sets nor reads user options,
 * so a window carrying one carries it because this file put it there.
 *
 * Three further narrowings, each closing a way to be wrong:
 *
 *  - A window a live phone is on is skipped. That is `phoneWindows`, the same
 *    question `restoreWindows` asks, and it is what keeps a second agentglass
 *    server booting on this machine from tearing down a phone session that is
 *    mid-sentence.
 *  - A window whose `window-size` ALREADY equals the recorded value is not
 *    touched at all — the mark is simply removed. Nothing is owed there, and
 *    the `resize-window -A` a blind restore would run is itself a visible
 *    change: `-A` sizes the window to the largest attached client and, per the
 *    manpage and the probe, writes `manual` while doing it.
 *  - A mark holding anything but one of tmux's four legal values is removed and
 *    obeyed by nothing.
 *
 * AND WHAT WOULD STILL MAKE IT WRONG, stated rather than papered over: a user
 * who sets `window-size manual` BY HAND on a window that is carrying a mark
 * from an earlier phone visit. The next boot would put their value back to what
 * the phone found. The two deliberate paths inside the app — the panel's `fit`
 * button and `takeover`, which are how a `manual` gets set on purpose here —
 * drop the mark as they write, so this is narrowed to a `set-option` typed into
 * tmux itself. Window ids cannot make it worse: measured on 3.6a, killing `@1`
 * and creating two windows gave `@2` and `@3`, so a mark cannot be inherited by
 * a different window on the same server.
 *
 * ONCE PER SERVER. At the moment this runs no phone in THIS process has
 * attached to anything, so every mark it can see belongs to a run that is gone
 * — the same "stale by definition" argument `releaseStale` makes, at the same
 * point in the lifecycle. Both entry points share `sizeSwept`, so a server
 * reached at boot is not walked again when a panel first resolves a client on
 * it.
 *
 * Cost, measured on this machine against a private server holding an 8-window
 * session: 2.4ms for the whole walk when no window carries a mark, which is
 * every boot after a clean shutdown and is one `list-windows -a` and nothing
 * else. 28.3ms in the worst case measured — all eight marked, one of them
 * actually pinned — and that is the run that happens once, after a kill.
