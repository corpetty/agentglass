/**
 * Talking to the tmux session running inside a panel's shell.
 *
 * The panel used to do the opposite of this: detect tmux and stand down, on the
 * grounds that tmux owns the tabs. It does own them, and that left the one strip
 * of the workspace we do not control being drawn by whatever `.tmux.conf` the
 * machine happens to carry — the same user, on two laptops, gets two different
 * looking window lists pasted across an otherwise coherent panel.
 *
 * So: we draw, tmux decides. Everything here either asks tmux what it has or
 * asks it to do something a keybinding could already have done. No state is kept
 * about which window is active, no input is intercepted, and every keybinding
 * behaves exactly as it did before, because the shell still receives every byte.
 * A click on a tab is `select-window` and nothing more.
 *
 * Linux-only, like the detection it grew out of: it reads /proc to find the tmux
 * client and the terminal it is attached to. Anywhere else this reports nothing
 * and the panel keeps its own chrome, which is the correct fallback rather than
 * a degraded one.

 * Everything below this line talks to a tmux server somebody else started.
 * That is the point of the file — the app follows the sessions the user is
 * already working in rather than making its own — and it is also the whole of
 * the risk, because a session we did not create is still one we can resize,
 * rename, kill, rebind and switch away from. That risk is not theoretical
 * here. A `resize-window -A` once wrote `window-size manual` across five
 * windows somebody was working in, and a phone attaching at its own size once
 * squeezed a real session to 80x24. Both are fixed. Neither was predicted, and
 * the next one will not be either.
 *
 * So there is a way to run the whole app with its hands behind its back:
 *
 *   AGENTGLASS_TMUX_OBSERVE_ONLY=1
 *
 * With it set, every command that could change the server is refused at the
 * one place they all pass through, and every command that only asks a question
 * runs exactly as before. The tab strip still draws, the pane list still fills,
 * the machine view still finds agents; clicking a tab does nothing, and says so
 * on stderr. The classification is `tmuxWriteCommands` below, and it fails
 * CLOSED: a verb it has never heard of counts as a write.
 *
 * A refused write answers `null`, which is what a tmux that said no answers
 * too — see the note on `tmux()`. That is deliberate and it is why this can be
 * a switch at all rather than a rewrite: every caller in this file is already
 * written for a tmux that refuses, because every one of them is inside a poll
 * that must survive a server going away mid-frame.
 *
 * NOT the default, and that is a decision rather than an oversight. Observing
 * is the safe behaviour and writing is the useful one, so making this the
 * default would turn a feature off for everyone already relying on it in order
 * to protect them from a class of bug that is, today, closed. The switch and
 * the honest inventory in `docs/BLAST-RADIUS.md` are the deliverable; flipping
 * the default is a separate change with its own evidence to gather.

 *
 * This blanked the row rather than removing it, and the reason was real: with
 * no status row allocated, `prefix ,`, `prefix .`, `prefix :` and every
 * `display-message` are drawn over the top line of the shell, because that is
 * the row where the status line would have been. Nothing is lost — the pane's
 * content is untouched underneath and comes back when the message clears — but
 * it looks like the terminal is being scribbled on.
 *
 * The row is now removed, and the prompts are taken instead of tolerated:
 * `prefix ,` and `prefix .` are rebound to leave a note on the window
 * (`@agx-ask`), which the sweep already reading this session picks up and hands
 * to the panel, which opens its own input. Same keys, same muscle memory, a row
 * of screen back, and a rename box that matches the app it is drawn in.
 *
 * What is left is what we cannot intercept: a plugin's own `display-message`
 * still paints over the top line for its two seconds. That is the honest cost
 * of the row, and it is the one the user chose by taking the row back.
 *
 * Opt-in, and it has to be: these are session options, not client ones, so a
 * second client attached to the same session from a real terminal is affected
 * too. `set-option -u` puts each one back exactly as their config had it,

 *  a module constant: `bun test` runs every file in one process and several of
 *  them set TMUX_TMPDIR after this module is already imported.
 *
 *  Two deliberate departures from `machineSocketDir`, and it matters which is
 *  which:
 *
 *   * TMUX_TMPDIR set but not a usable directory no longer answers itself. It
 *     used to, and that is the bug: `socketPath([])` reported
 *     `/tmp/absent/tmux-1000/default` while the command tmux actually ran
 *     landed on `/tmp/tmux-1000/default`. Falling back here makes the modelled
 *     path and the real one the same path again.
 *
 *   * With TMUX_TMPDIR unset, UNDER TEST, this answers `tmpdir()`, which tmux
 *     would not. Kept on purpose: `tmux-test-isolation.test.ts` builds its
 *     stand-in socket directory by pointing TMPDIR at a scratch path precisely
 *     because tmux ignores TMPDIR, so the fixture's own server and the code
 *     under test reach the same directory through different variables without
 *     either of them going near /tmp/tmux-<uid>. That divergence is safe ONLY
 *     because `tmuxSocketAllowed` now refuses the real socket outright instead
 *     of inferring it from this function — see the note there. Nothing in this
 *     file may go back to deriving safety from how well this models tmux.
 *
 *     In the app the divergence was a bug on a Mac, where the two directories
 *     are never the same: `os.tmpdir()` is `/var/folders/<2>/<30>/T` and tmux's
 *     `_PATH_TMP` is `/tmp`, so `tmuxSockets()` read a `tmux-501/` no tmux had
 *     ever written to, and "where is that agent sitting" found nothing on a
 *     machine with a server full of panes. On Linux the two agree whenever
 *     TMPDIR is unset, which is why nobody saw it. Outside a test run the
 *     answer is therefore the directory tmux actually uses, on every platform;
 *     the `tmpdir()` reading stays for the fixture that needs it. Gated on
 *     NODE_ENV rather than on the platform, so a Linux user who exports TMPDIR
 *     gets the same correct answer a Mac does. */

 * that directory is `/tmp/tmux-1000`, which on the machine this was written on
 * holds three sessions somebody is working in. The boot sweep added in 8983791
 * walks every socket that listing returns and sends `resize-window -A`,
 * `set-option -w window-size` and `refresh-client` at anything carrying
 * `@agx-had-size`. Counted: 18 test files spawn the server as a child, and 15
 * of them handed it no TMUX_TMPDIR — so `bun test` in server/ or mobile/ was
 * one marked window away from resizing a real session. Measured while writing this: none
 * of his windows carried the mark, so nothing had been damaged yet — that is a
 * fact about that afternoon, not about the code.
 *
 * This is the same guard NODE_ENV already gives the database (#319), the
 * settings file (#321) and `tmuxpane`'s `new-session` (which refuses without
 * AGENTGLASS_TMUX_SOCKET), and it is the invariant `test/tmuxIsolated.ts`
 * exists to defend after a suite once restored somebody's whole workspace into
 * itself. It FAILS CLOSED: a test that needs a real tmux must name a private
 * TMUX_TMPDIR, which is the thing that made it safe in the first place, so a
 * test file that forgets gets a sweep that does nothing rather than a sweep
 * that reaches the desk.
 *
 * A LIMIT, stated rather than papered over: `NODE_ENV=test` is set by
 * `bun test` in the TEST process, and measured on Bun 1.3.9 it reaches a child
 * spawned with `env: {...process.env}` and NOT one spawned with a named
 * environment — which is how most of the suite spawns the server. Those
 * children are covered by `tmux-test-isolation.test.ts`, which reads every test
 * file and fails if one spawns `src/index.ts` without handing it a TMUX_TMPDIR.
 * Guard and lint are two halves of one rule; neither is sufficient alone.
 *
 * WHAT "SET" MEANS, and the reason this used to fail open despite the sentence
 * above claiming otherwise. The test was `!process.env.TMUX_TMPDIR` — the
 * variable, not the directory. A TMUX_TMPDIR naming a directory that is NOT
 * THERE therefore read as isolation while tmux silently fell back to
 * /tmp/tmux-<uid>: the one arrangement where the guard unlocked itself and the
 * command went to the developer's server. Reproduced through this module, with
 * NODE_ENV=test, `$TMUX` cleared and TMUX_TMPDIR naming an absent directory:
 *
 *   socketPath([])         /tmp/agx-test-tmux-ABSENT/tmux-1000/default
 *   guard says allowed     true
 *   commands that landed   display-message -p -t @1 #{window_width}
 *                          show-options -gv prefix        ** on his server **
 *
 * That precondition is not contrived: `test/tmuxTmp.ts` creates one fixed
 * directory in a `catch {}` and exports the path either way, so a single failed
 * mkdir — a stale root-owned /tmp/agx-test-tmux, a full disk, someone's cleanup
 * script — hands every spawned child exactly this. Asking the filesystem
 * instead of the environment is what makes the sentence above true.

/**
 * May a tmux command reach this socket at all?
 *
 * Exported so it can be asserted directly, and that is not a convenience. The
 * rule is about the socket a bare `tmux` — no `-S`, no `-L` — lands on, and a
 * bare invocation cannot be aimed at a stand-in: `-S` and `-L` are the only two
 * things that redirect it, and using either makes it no longer the case under
 * test. A test that drove a real command through the empty socket to watch it
 * be refused would therefore be aimed at the developer's own server, and would
 * hit it on the one run the guard was missing — which is the run the test
 * exists for. So the refusal is asserted here, where asserting it costs
 * nothing, and the behavioural half of the test only ever drives `-S <stand-in>`.
 *
 * THREE refusals, because there are three ways for this process to be next to
 * his tmux and each version of this guard has known one more than the last:
 *
 *   1. `$TMUX`, ALWAYS — a private TMUX_TMPDIR does not buy it back. Agents in
 *      this repo run inside his tmux, so `bun test` inherits a `$TMUX` naming
 *      his socket, and a bare command goes there whatever TMUX_TMPDIR says.
 *      Nothing in this repo ever sets `$TMUX`: the four suites that run a
 *      server of their own name it with `-L agx-…`, which is checked first and
 *      is not this. So "the socket $TMUX names" is a precise spelling of "his",
 *      not a heuristic.
 *
 *   2. `/tmp/tmux-<uid>/default`, ALWAYS — the machine's real socket, refused
 *      as a constant rather than inferred. This is the one that was missing,
 *      and its absence is what made the other two conditional on a model.
 *      Every earlier version asked "is the socket about to be used the same as
 *      the one `socketDir()` predicts", so a `socketDir()` that predicted the
 *      wrong directory unlocked the right one. Two ways that happened: a
 *      TMUX_TMPDIR naming an absent directory (tmux falls back to /tmp, the
 *      model did not — see `usableTmuxTmpdir`), and TMPDIR redirected while
 *      TMUX_TMPDIR was unset (`os.tmpdir()` follows TMPDIR, tmux ignores it —
 *      see `machineSocketDir`), which is the arrangement
 *      `tmux-test-isolation.test.ts` itself runs in. Neither needs a model to
 *      be caught: under test that path is not ours, whatever else is true.
 *
 *   3. The default socket of the directory in force, when no usable
 *      TMUX_TMPDIR was named. This is the CI shape — no `$TMUX`, nothing set —
 *      and it is what makes the guard fail closed for a test file that forgets.
 *      It also still carries the stand-in case: with TMPDIR redirected, the
 *      stand-in's own `default` is refused, which is what stops that fixture
 *      from passing vacuously.
 *
 * Compared through `sameSocket`, not raw. `-S //tmp/tmux-1000/default`,
 * `-S /tmp/tmux-1000/./default` and `-S /tmp/tmux-1000/../tmux-1000/default`
 * all named his socket and all three used to be ALLOWED by all three rules
 * above, because each one compared strings. Nothing spells it that way today;
 * "nothing spells it that way today" is also what was true of the two holes
 * this same function has already been fixed for.
 *
 * The old LIMIT here — "with TMUX_TMPDIR set and no `$TMUX`, an explicit
 * `-S /tmp/tmux-<uid>/default` is allowed" — is gone rather than restated:
 * refusal 2 is exactly it, closed.

/**
 * Is this socket inside the private socket directory this process was given?
 *
 * A DIFFERENT question from `tmuxSocketAllowed`, and the reason it exists is
 * that it is not gated on NODE_ENV. Measured on Bun 1.3.9, `bun test` puts
 * NODE_ENV=test in the test process and it does NOT reach a child spawned with
 * a named environment — which is how nearly every suite here starts the server.
 * To every `process.env.NODE_ENV` check in this repo, such a child is
 * indistinguishable from production, so no amount of NODE_ENV guarding reaches
 * it.
 *
 * TMUX_TMPDIR is the one signal that does survive that spawn — the lint at the
 * bottom of `tmux-test-isolation.test.ts` fails the build if a suite spawns the
 * server without one — so it is the only thing a rule for that child can be
 * built on. The rule: a process handed a private socket directory may act on
 * servers INSIDE it and nowhere else. `/tmp/tmux-1000/default` is not inside
 * `/tmp/agx-test-tmux`.
 *
 * Free in production, checked: nothing in `server/src` or `desktop/` sets
 * TMUX_TMPDIR, so a real user's process is unconfined and this answers true —
 * and a user who does set one keeps their server inside it, so it answers true
 * for them too. It only ever refuses a process that was confined and then
 * reached outside its confinement.
 *
 * Applied at the two spawns in `themesync.ts` AND inside `tmux()` — the second
 * of those was the "obvious next change" this note used to defer, and what
 * made it due was finding the same reach through a door no NODE_ENV guard can
 * see: six scripts in `scripts/` spawn `server/src/index.ts`, none under `bun
 * test`, and every tmux command that server runs — the boot sweep, and
 * `listPanes` on every `/panes` request — resolved against `/tmp/tmux-<uid>`.
 * With those scripts now naming a private TMUX_TMPDIR (`scripts/tmuxTmp.ts`),
 * this is what makes that naming binding on all of them at once instead of on

 * turned into wheel events and handed to xterm, and xterm's answer to a wheel on
 * the alternate screen with no scrollback of its own is a cursor key: measured
 * through the shipped page against a pane running `cat -v`, one drag delivered
 * 53 of them and the screen moved a single line. Arrows walk history onto a
 * prompt, and in an agent's TUI they move whatever is selected — including the
 * two buttons on a permission gate. Nothing on the phone can encode a scroll
 * safely, because a terminal has no way to say "scroll" that is not a key or a
 * mouse report. tmux does, and this is it.
 *
 * ── what it costs, said plainly ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * Copy mode is a property of the PANE, not of a client, so the desk sees it too
 * — and that is not a new cost this introduces. It is exactly what tmux itself
 * does when it has the mouse: `WheelUpPane` is bound to `copy-mode -e` followed
 * by the wheel, and with `mouse on` a phone drag already put the shared pane
 * into copy mode at scroll_position 33 (measured, same rig). The difference is
 * only which side asks for it.
 *
 * `-e` is what makes it clean up after itself: scrolling back down to the
 * bottom LEAVES copy mode. Measured on 3.6a — `send-keys -X -N 200 scroll-down`
 * against a pane 85 lines up ended with pane_in_mode 0 — so the ordinary way out
 * of a scroll is also the way out of the mode, with nothing to remember.
 *
 * The pane is the one the phone's own client is looking at, asked of tmux rather
 * than remembered from the attach: `windowId` on PhoneAttach is documented as
 * routing and not truth, and a phone can walk to another window with tmux's own
 * keys. The session name is ours and is checked against the one pattern this app
 * ever creates, so this can only ever address a window a phone of ours is on.
 *
 * Answers the pane it acted on and whether that pane is STILL in copy mode, so
 * the caller can hand the mode back if it was this that started it — and null
 * when it did nothing at all and so knows nothing.

 * real ptys: a 40-column phone joining a 200-column desk took the desk down to
 * 40 — identically for the grouped session and for a naive `attach -t`. The
 * whole point of the grouped session was to avoid exactly that, and it did not.
 *
 * `window-size largest` is what does it: the window follows the biggest client
 * instead of the newest, so the desk keeps its size and the phone sees the
 * top-left of it. The option is set on a session named HERE and belonging to
 * us, never on the user's — a companion that permanently changes an option on
 * somebody's working session has fixed its own problem by creating theirs.
 *
 * That session also runs with tmux's own status line off. Without it the phone
 * shows two window lists stacked: the app draws its own tab strip, and directly
 * under it tmux paints the same windows again, on the screen with the least
 * vertical space to spare. `status` is a session option, so turning it off on
 * the session named here costs nobody else anything — measured with two real
 * ptys against a grouped pair, the desk's client went on painting its bar (its
 * session name and its clock kept arriving on its pty after the phone attached,
 * and its session still reports no `status` of its own, so it is still reading
 * the user's global value) while the phone's pty carried neither. Without the
 * option the phone painted the bar, which is the control that says it is this
 * line doing the work. The desk's bar is the user's own configuration and is
 * not ours to switch off.
 *
 * Every id is checked against tmux's own syntax and the pane is looked up in
 * the live list rather than trusted, so a caller can only ever name a pane that
 * exists on a server this machine is already running. The socket comes from
 * that lookup — it is never accepted from a client, because a filesystem path
 * from the UI reaching a spawn is the whole class of bug this file avoids.

/*
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE PIN LEDGER: which tmux servers this installation has ever pinned on.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN ANOTHER ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE. The boot sweep
 * used to be handed `tmuxSockets()` — a listing of `$TMUX_TMPDIR/tmux-<uid>`,
 * which with TMUX_TMPDIR unset is `/tmp/tmux-<uid>`, this developer's own
 * sockets — and the only thing standing in front of it was
 * `blindTmuxBanned()`, whose first line is `if (process.env.NODE_ENV !==
 * "test") return false`. A server that is not under `bun test` was therefore
 * not guarded at all, and six scripts in `scripts/` spawn exactly that server:
 * soak, loadtest, perfbudget, capture-live, conflict-drive, browser-drive.
 * Each one carefully redirects AGENTGLASS_DB, XDG_CONFIG_HOME, XDG_DATA_HOME
 * and XDG_CACHE_HOME, and none of them set NODE_ENV or TMUX_TMPDIR. Measured
 * with the exact environment `perfbudget.ts` hands its child, `$TMUX` cleared:
 *
 *   NODE_ENV = undefined   TMUX_TMPDIR = undefined
 *   socketPath([])  /tmp/tmux-1000/default
 *   allowed([])     true
 *   tmuxSockets()   25 sockets, his default among them
 *
 * That is the THIRD time this same reach has been closed, each time through a
 * door the previous fix did not know about: a guard for `bun test`, then a lint
 * over `server/test` and `mobile/test`, and now a population — files that spawn
 * the server — that neither of those had a name for. Giving those six scripts a
 * TMUX_TMPDIR (done, `scripts/tmuxTmp.ts`) is the same shape as both previous
 * fixes: it protects the six that exist and nothing about the seventh.
 *
 * So the default is inverted. The sweep no longer asks "is there a reason to
 * refuse"; it asks the process to DEMONSTRATE the socket is one it owns, and
 * touches nothing it cannot prove. NODE_ENV is not consulted, so this holds for
 * a script's server, a `bun run` in a checkout, CI, and an Electron sidecar
 * alike.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS PROOF. The sweep exists to undo `window-size manual` that a
 * previous run of THIS INSTALLATION left on a window and was SIGKILLed before
 * releasing. There is exactly one line in this file that writes the
 * `@agx-had-size` mark such a run leaves — the `set-option` in
 * `windowSizeOptions` — so "sockets we could have marked" is a set this app can
 * write down at the instant it marks one, and read back at the next boot. It
 * lives beside the database and the settings, under $XDG_DATA_HOME, because
 * that is where this app's identity already is.
 *
 * WHAT IT COVERS: any launcher whose data directory is not this installation's
 * — which is all six scripts (they redirect XDG_DATA_HOME today), every test
 * that redirects it, CI, and a fresh checkout — sweeps NOTHING, whatever it
 * does with NODE_ENV or TMUX_TMPDIR, because its ledger is empty. A boot that
 * has never pinned anything issues zero tmux commands, so it never even lists
 * his socket directory.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, plainly: a launcher that redirects nothing at all.
 * Such a process reads this installation's ledger and would perform this
 * installation's own recovery — the same windows the app itself would release
 * at its next boot, never a stranger's socket. That residue is irreducible: a
 * process holding the app's database, settings and data directory is the app by
 * every signal that exists. What changed is the blast radius — from "every tmux
 * server on the machine" to "the servers this install has pinned on".
 *
 * AND THE ONE THING IT COSTS: a window pinned by a build from BEFORE this
 * ledger existed, orphaned by a SIGKILL, is never released — there is no entry
 * for it and no way to invent one. One upgrade boundary, for the windows
 * orphaned across it; `fit` and `takeover` still clear their own marks, and
 * everything pinned after the upgrade is recorded.

 *
 * The first rule is not a test convenience, and the first full suite run after
 * this ledger was written is why it exists. It put a fixture socket into the
 * developer's real `~/.local/share/agentglass/pinned-tmux-sockets`:
 *
 *   /tmp/agx-tmux-claim-1440175/tmux-1000/agx-claim
 *
 * `tmux-attach-claim.test.ts` drives `attachArgvFor`, which pins a window,
 * which writes here. That file is correctly isolated — private TMUX_TMPDIR,
 * `-f /dev/null`, its own socket name — and it still wrote into his data
 * directory, because nothing in tmuxctl.ts had ever written there before and no
 * test had reason to redirect XDG_DATA_HOME. Every other suite that pins is the
 * same shape, and so is every launcher: `tmux-sigkill-restore` hands its server
 * child TMUX_TMPDIR and XDG_CONFIG_HOME and no XDG_DATA_HOME. Requiring a
 * second variable would be the third round of "protect the callers that exist".
 *
 * So the record follows the thing it is a record OF. A process handed a private
 * TMUX_TMPDIR has a private tmux world, its pins are about servers in that
 * directory, and they are meaningless to any other. It also fixes the lifetime:
 * a fixture's entries die with `rmSync(TMPDIR)` instead of outliving the sockets
 * they name by months. And it holds for a real user who exports TMUX_TMPDIR —
 * the file sits beside their sockets and persists exactly as long as those do,
 * so their boot sweep goes on working across restarts.
 *
 * `$TMUX_TMPDIR/agentglass-pinned-sockets`, and NOT inside `tmux-<uid>/` one
 * level down: `tmuxSockets()` maps every entry of that directory to a socket,
 * so a file in there would be handed to the sweep as a server to walk.
 *
 * The NODE_ENV floor underneath is for the case neither covers — a test that
 * pins with no TMUX_TMPDIR at all. `tmuxSocketAllowed` refuses those before
 * they reach a real server, so it is belt and braces; it costs one string
 * compare and it means no arrangement of variables writes a test's pins into

 * its own copy of four windows with a `claude --resume` inside every one. 525
 * MCP processes and 13 GB of memory, on a machine nine hours from a cold boot,

 *
 * The failure closes over itself: the record is the only memory of what to
 * clean, it lives on disk, and when it goes the sweep cannot fail loudly — it
 * finds nothing to do and reports success. A mirror whose record is lost is
 * immortal.
 *
 * So this is the second rule, and it deliberately does NOT use the record. A
 * session is killed only when ALL of these hold:
 *
 *   - the name matches `PHONE_SESSION`, so it is one this app makes;
 *   - it carries our mirror stamp, so it is one THIS app made and not a name
 *     somebody else chose;
 *   - nothing is attached to it, so no phone is looking at it.
 *
 * The stamp is what keeps a phone-shaped heuristic out of a socket that may be
 * the user's own — the same reason the lease sweep verifies it. A session with
 * no stamp is left alone however much its name looks like ours.

   * One tab, one pane.

   * window gives the phone's tab strip four tabs that are all the same 2x2
   * grid. Measured on the emulator against a 44-column client: with no zoom the
   * phone's own screen carried the first line of all four panes (PANE-A/B/C/D
   * markers, every one of them), whichever pane had been tapped. Four
   * destinations, one destination. And each of them a quarter of an already
   * narrow screen — about 40 columns, where prose breaks every three words.
   * With the zoom the same client carried the tapped pane's marker and no other.
   *
   * ON, and not a switch, and that is a decision rather than an omission. A
   * switch would have to be asked for by the phone, and this server does not
   * own the phone's code — so an off-by-default zoom is a feature nothing can
   * turn on. It is also not a choice the person tapping a pane has any way to
   * make: they tapped ONE pane, which is the request.
   *
   * The cost is real and is the same cost the fit has: zoom is a window flag
   * and a grouped session shares the window, so the desk sees it, and it does
   * not undo itself when the phone goes (measured: a window left zoomed by a
   * killed phone still reports the flag two seconds later). Both halves are
   * answered the way the fit answers them — a notice with a way out on the desk
   * (see `takeover` and the row in TerminalPanel) and a restore on the way out
   * (see `restoreWindows`).
   *
   * Not a window the desk has just taken back. Take-over unzooms, and the phone
   * is told so and remounts with `fit` off — which comes straight back through
   * here. Without this the desk's click would be undone within the second by
   * the reconnection it caused. A deliberate fit releases the claim first (the
   * line above), so the phone asking again does get its zoom back.
   *
   * "Already zoomed" is NOT a reason to stand down, and reading it as one is
   * the bug the emulator found: tapping the second tab of the same window
   * opened it with the window already zoomed by the first tab, so this sent
   * nothing — and the tab showed the 2x2 grid again, which is the whole defect
   * back for every tab but the first.
   *
   * The command sequence handles it, and only measurement says so (tmux 3.6a,
   * a three-pane window):
   *
   *   resize-pane -Z -t A            z=1  active=A
   *   select-pane  -t B              z=0  active=B   <- selecting UNZOOMS
   *   resize-pane -Z -t B            z=1  active=B
   *   ... and -Z -t B with no select first: z=0, active still A — the toggle
   *       applies to the WINDOW, so it takes the other pane's zoom off instead
   *
   * The `select-pane` above already runs before the zoom, so a window zoomed
   * onto somebody else's pane is unzoomed by it and re-zoomed onto ours. The
   * one case that must send nothing is a window already zoomed onto OUR pane —
   * a reconnect, or the same tab twice — where `select-pane` keeps the zoom
   * (measured) and a `resize-pane -Z` would take it off. It is still owed back:
   * whoever zoomed it has had its teardown skipped for as long as we are here.
   *
   * What is NOT restored is a zoom the desk had on a DIFFERENT pane: it is
   * unzoomed rather than put back, because tmux offers no way to tell a phone's
   * zoom from a person's, and showing the phone a pane it did not open is the
   * thing this exists to stop. The notice on the desk says the phone did it and

 *   phone fitted                          80x24  window-size=manual
 *   `-A` on the way out                  200x49  window-size=manual
 *   desk then resizes its terminal 160x45 200x49  window-size=manual
 *
 * One phone visit and the user's own terminal stopped reflowing their tmux, on
 * every window in the session, permanently, with nothing on screen to say why.
 * So the option goes back too — AFTER the `-A`, because the `-A` is what sets
 * it, and doing them the other way round writes `manual` over the restore.
 *
 * `hadWindowSize` is what each window carried before the phone's command ran
 * (see `windowSizeOptions`); an empty string means the window had none of its
 * own and the restore is an unset. Only those windows are touched: they are the
 * ones that existed when the phone arrived, and `-A`ing a window we have no
 * record of would cost it its `window-size` to fix a squeeze it never had.
 *
 * Called on the way out rather than trusted to happen: our session dies with
 * the client (`destroy-unattached on`), and a window whose only small client
 * has gone still holds the small size until somebody recomputes it.
 *
 * The zoom is the second thing owed back and the reason this is no longer
 * called `restoreWindowSizes`. A zoom is not a size — it is a window flag, it
 * belongs to the shared window exactly as `window-size` does, and it outlives
 * the phone in exactly the same way: measured on a private server, a window a
 * phone zoomed still reports `window_zoomed_flag` 1 with the phone's client
 * killed and its session gone. `zoomed` names the one window this attach is
 * responsible for and the pane it is zoomed onto, so nothing else is touched.

 * THE HOLE THIS FILLS. `restoreWindows` is correct and is reached from three
 * places: the socket closing, `cleanup`'s two timers, and `shutdownTerminals`
 * on SIGINT/SIGTERM. Every one of them is code running inside the server. A
 * SIGKILL, an OOM kill, or the machine going down runs none of it, and the
 * `window-size manual` that a phone's fit writes onto the DESK'S window then
 * lasts as long as that tmux server does.
 *
 * It is not theoretical. Reported with a screenshot after the app had been
 * killed hard several times in one day — one window of a five-window session
 * stuck with a gap along the bottom:
 *
 *   work:2  agent-a  267x59  window-size=latest
 *   work:3  agent-b  267x59  window-size=latest
 *   work:4  agent-c  267x59  window-size=latest
 *   work:5  agent-d  277x54  window-size=manual   <- the only one
 *   work:6  agent-e  267x59  window-size=latest
 *
 * 54 rows against a 59-row client: those five rows ARE the gap. The window had
 * stopped following the terminal it was drawn in, permanently, and nothing
 * anywhere pointed at the app that had done it.
 *
 * WHAT PROVES A SERVER IS OURS TO WALK, asked before any of what follows and
 * answered without consulting NODE_ENV: the pin ledger, which this installation
 * writes at the instant it takes a window's size. No record, no walk — not even
 * a `list-windows`. That is what stops a server spawned by `make soak`, `make
 * perf` or `make loadtest` from reaching the developer's own sockets, and it is
 * the level the two previous fixes for this (a `bun test` guard, then a lint
 * over the test roots) were both aimed below. See THE PIN LEDGER above for what
 * it covers and what it does not.
 *
 * WHAT PROVES A WINDOW IS OURS, since the alternative is undoing somebody's own
 * setting. Only the `@agx-had-size` mark, written in `windowSizeOptions` at the
 * moment of capture and nowhere else. tmux neither sets nor reads user options,
 * so a window carrying one carries it because this file put it there.
 *
 * Three further narrowings, each closing a way to be wrong:
 *
 *  - A window a live phone is on is skipped. That is `phoneWindows`, the same
 *    question `restoreWindows` asks, and it is what keeps a second agentglass
 *    server booting on this machine from tearing down a phone session that is
 *    mid-sentence.
 *  - A window whose `window-size` ALREADY equals the recorded value is not
 *    touched at all — the mark is simply removed. Nothing is owed there, and
 *    the `resize-window -A` a blind restore would run is itself a visible
 *    change: `-A` sizes the window to the largest attached client and, per the
 *    manpage and the probe, writes `manual` while doing it.
 *  - A mark holding anything but one of tmux's four legal values is removed and
 *    obeyed by nothing.
 *
 * AND WHAT WOULD STILL MAKE IT WRONG, stated rather than papered over: a user
 * who sets `window-size manual` BY HAND on a window that is carrying a mark
 * from an earlier phone visit. The next boot would put their value back to what
 * the phone found. The two deliberate paths inside the app — the panel's `fit`
 * button and `takeover`, which are how a `manual` gets set on purpose here —
 * drop the mark as they write, so this is narrowed to a `set-option` typed into
 * tmux itself. Window ids cannot make it worse: measured on 3.6a, killing `@1`
 * and creating two windows gave `@2` and `@3`, so a mark cannot be inherited by
 * a different window on the same server.
 *
 * ONCE PER SERVER. At the moment this runs no phone in THIS process has
 * attached to anything, so every mark it can see belongs to a run that is gone
 * — the same "stale by definition" argument `releaseStale` makes, at the same
 * point in the lifecycle. Both entry points share `sizeSwept`, so a server
 * reached at boot is not walked again when a panel first resolves a client on
 * it.
 *
 * Cost, measured on this machine against a private server holding an 8-window
 * session: 2.4ms for the whole walk when no window carries a mark, which is
 * every boot after a clean shutdown and is one `list-windows -a` and nothing
 * else. 28.3ms in the worst case measured — all eight marked, one of them
 * actually pinned — and that is the run that happens once, after a kill.
