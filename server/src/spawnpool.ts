// A ceiling on how many subprocesses this server has in flight at once.
//
// Making the git and docker reads concurrent fixed the freezes and created a
// different failure: nothing bounded the fan-out. A cold `/git/repos` is ~36
// processes on a repo with eighteen checkouts, `/git/worktrees` another ~60,
// and a panel that opens both at once — or a client that retries while they are
// still running — multiplies that again. Driven hard, the sidecar stopped
// answering entirely: not slow, gone. Concurrency without a limit is a fork
// bomb with good intentions.
//
// So every awaited spawn goes through here. The limit is per process and
// global, not per caller, because the resources being protected — file
// descriptors, pids, memory, the machine's patience — are shared by all of
// them. Work over the limit waits its turn instead of being refused: a slower
// dirty count is fine, a dead server is not.
//
// What this does NOT fix, measured rather than assumed: driving five expensive
// endpoints three times over concurrently still saturates the server — a route
// that does no work answers in ~700ms while the backlog drains. That is sixteen
// subprocesses' worth of pipe traffic on one thread, and it is real work rather
// than a stall; the app's own polls are seconds apart and never approach it.
// Handing the freed slot to the next waiter through a timer instead of inline
// was tried, on the theory that a chain of microtasks was starving I/O, and
// measured no better — so it is not here.
//
// Deliberately not applied to the synchronous `git()` helper. That one holds
// the event loop for its whole duration, so the loop itself already guarantees
// one at a time — and the goal is to delete those, not to queue them.

/**
 * How many at once.
 *
 * Sized off the machine rather than guessed: the work is process spawns, which
 * are CPU- and syscall-bound, and leaving a couple of cores for the server
 * itself (and for the shell the user is typing into, which is the whole point)
 * is what keeps the app responsive while a sweep runs. Bounded on both sides so
 * a single-core box still makes progress and a 64-core one does not decide that
 * 62 concurrent `git status` calls is a good idea.
 *
 * Read per call rather than fixed at import, for the same reason the watchdog's
 * ring size is: a module constant is decided by whichever file imports this
 * first, which in a test run is never the file doing the overriding.
 *
 * The trailing `|| 4` is not belt-and-braces. Where `navigator` is absent the
 * subtraction is NaN, and NaN poisons the clamp — `Math.max(4, Math.min(16,
 * NaN))` is NaN, `inflight >= NaN` is false forever, and the cap silently stops
 * existing while every counter and stat still reads plausibly. A limit that can
 * quietly become "no limit" is worse than no limit at all, because nothing ever
 * says so. NaN is falsy, so this lands on the floor instead.
