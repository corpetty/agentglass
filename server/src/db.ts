// output), so a "scan and sum a few integers" is really a walk over 190 MB of
// pages that are 98% payload the query never looks at. Warm it is tens of ms;
// with those historical pages evicted (nothing else keeps eight-day-old rows
// hot) each probe is a disk seek, and the six of them together are the 2–4 s
// `/stats` stalls the loop watchdog caught — on the one thread that also pumps
// the PTY WebSocket, so the terminal stops echoing for the duration.
//
// Worse, the GROUP BY queries drove off idx_events_{model,source,type}, which

// from index leaves (EXPLAIN: "USING COVERING INDEX"). Leading with the GROUP
// BY / range column keeps the grouping and the `timestamp >= ?` cutoff working

// /stats dropped 69 ms → 3.7 ms at 1 h and 125 ms → 35 ms at "all" *warm*, and
// far more cold, because a covering scan reads a few MB of compact index rather
// than seeking all over a 190 MB table. The indexes reused free pages left by
// retention pruning (net file growth ~0), and a fatter write path costs about
// 1 µs per inserted event — nothing next to the read it saves.
//
// One index per grouping, because the leading column has to match the GROUP BY
// for the scan to stay ordered *and* covering; a single timestamp-leading index
// covers the columns but the planner won't take it for a GROUP BY (it would owe
// a sort), so it falls back to the table probe. Kept alongside the narrow
