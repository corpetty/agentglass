// pages that are 98% payload the query never looks at. Warm it is tens of ms;
// with those historical pages evicted (nothing else keeps eight-day-old rows
// hot) each probe is a disk seek, and the six of them together are the 2–4 s
// `/stats` stalls the loop watchdog caught — on the one thread that also pumps
// the PTY WebSocket, so the terminal stops echoing for the duration.

// than seeking all over a 190 MB table. The indexes reused free pages left by
// retention pruning (net file growth ~0), and a fatter write path costs about
// 1 µs per inserted event — nothing next to the read it saves.

/**
 * One scanner per database file — enforced in the file, not by hoping.
 *
 * The transcript scanner is the one writer here that is NOT idempotent: its
 * events carry `event_id: null`, so the idempotency index above
 * (`WHERE event_id IS NOT NULL`) cannot see, let alone drop, a line ingested
 * twice. Two server processes on one file therefore inflate event counts,
 * tokens and dollars in silence — nothing errors, the totals just grow.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. Measured on this machine's own 354 MB history on
 * 2026-08-07: 22 duplicate groups, 22 extra rows out of 100,354 scanner events.
 * Small, and that is exactly why it went unnoticed for so long. Measured in the
 * lab with two real processes racing one live tail: 4 appended turns became 5
 * events and 5,000 input tokens instead of 4,000.
 *
 * It is easy to reach: `defaultDbPath()` resolves to the XDG data dir, so any
 * checkout without a local `agentglass.db` — none of the worktrees on this
 * machine have one — runs its scanner over the real history. The README's
 * "attaches, never duplicates" only fires on a `:4000` port collision, and a
 * second server started on another port on purpose sails straight past it.
 *
 * So the second process is held off here: the claim row names a pid and a port,
 * and whoever finds a LIVE claim that is not theirs runs with the scanner
 * disabled (see `startScanner`). Everything else it does — serving, hook ingest,
 * git, the terminal — is unaffected, and hook ingest is idempotent anyway.
 *
 * A stale claim must never lock anyone out: this app is SIGKILLed routinely
 * (the desktop shell kills its sidecar, `pkill` during development), so the row
 * regularly outlives its process. `holderAlive` is what decides, and it is
 * deliberately three checks deep because a bare `kill(pid, 0)` is wrong twice
 * over — pids are reused after a reboot and after wraparound.

 * What survives the prune.

 * Raw events are deleted at AGENTGLASS_RETENTION_DAYS, which is right for

 * worth asking: what a project cost last month, this sprint against the last,
 * whether a budget is being kept. The only escape was raising retention and
 * paying for it in database size and query time.
 *
 * So expiring events are folded into a day-grained summary before they are
 * deleted. One row per (day, project, session, model, provider) is small
 * enough to keep for years — a busy month of one project is a few thousand
 * rows against a few hundred thousand events.
 *
 * What does NOT survive, and cannot: percentiles. p50 and p95 do not
 * aggregate — an average of percentiles is not a percentile of anything. The
 * total duration and the number of timed calls are carried instead, which
 * gives an honest mean and nothing it cannot support.
 *
 * The key columns COALESCE to '' rather than allowing NULL, because NULLs are
 * distinct from each other in a UNIQUE index and the upsert would insert a
 * new row every night instead of accumulating.

 *  worktree added: the loop watchdog caught `/events/filter-options` at 1432ms
 *  and `/sessions` at 1078ms, on the thread that carries the terminal.
 *

 *  contains is tiny and indexed; work out which of *those* are in scope here,
 *  in a language that can do it once instead of per row, and hand SQLite an
 *  equality test it can index. Same rows, measured 194ms → 9ms on the same
 *  query — and it no longer degrades as checkouts are added.
