 * Why this process may not open the default database, or null when it may.
 *
 * THE DEFAULT DATABASE BELONGS TO THE INSTALLED APP. Nothing else asked for it:
 * a server run from a checkout, a `bun -e` that imports this file, a binary
 * built into a worktree's staging directory — each reaches the XDG data dir
 * only because it named nothing else. Measured: a worktree build whose
 * migration rebuilt a table with a new primary key ran there, and the
 * installed release then failed on its first line at every launch, because
 * its upsert names a conflict target the rebuilt table no longer has.
 *
 * "Installed" is a compiled binary that lives neither inside a checkout of
 * this repo (one with `electron/build.mjs`, so a home directory kept in git
 * does not count) nor under the temp directory, where a probe copies a build.
 * An AppImage mount, a .deb, a Mac bundle and `make desktop-install`'s copy all
 * qualify; `bun run src/index.ts` and `electron/staging/agentglass-server` do
 * not. A database under the temp directory is nobody's history and is let
 * through, as `testDbPath` lets it through.
 *
 * The ceilings: an installed binary of an OLDER or NEWER release is still an
 * install, and opens the file — that is the schema generation's job below. A
 * build copied somewhere else by hand passes for an install. And a run from
 * source with XDG_DATA_HOME pointed at a scratch directory outside the temp
 * directory is refused too: nothing here can tell that from a real data dir.

// had (idx_events_ts / _model / _source / _type) satisfy the WHERE or the
// GROUP BY, but not the columns being SUMmed, so SQLite seeks each matching
// rowid back into the table to read them. That table is the problem — its rows
// carry a `payload` TEXT up to 68 KB (a full prompt, a file's contents, command
// output), so a "scan and sum a few integers" is really a walk over 190 MB of
// pages that are 98% payload the query never looks at. Warm it is tens of ms;
// with those historical pages evicted (nothing else keeps eight-day-old rows
// hot) each probe is a disk seek, and the six of them together are the 2–4 s
// `/stats` stalls the loop watchdog caught — on the one thread that also pumps
// the PTY WebSocket, so the terminal stops echoing for the duration.
//
// Worse, the GROUP BY queries drove off idx_events_{model,source,type}, which
// carry no timestamp, so they scanned *every* row and probed the table to
// re-check the window — the default 1 h view paid a full 50 k-row table walk
// three times over, five-second poll after five-second poll.
//
// The columns each aggregation reads are few and small, so fold them into the
// index and the query never touches the table at all — SQLite answers straight
// from index leaves (EXPLAIN: "USING COVERING INDEX"). Leading with the GROUP
// BY / range column keeps the grouping and the `timestamp >= ?` cutoff working
// off the same b-tree. Measured on the 50 k-row production copy: the whole
// /stats dropped 69 ms → 3.7 ms at 1 h and 125 ms → 35 ms at "all" *warm*, and
// far more cold, because a covering scan reads a few MB of compact index rather
// than seeking all over a 190 MB table. The indexes reused free pages left by
// retention pruning (net file growth ~0), and a fatter write path costs about
// 1 µs per inserted event — nothing next to the read it saves.
//
// One index per grouping, because the leading column has to match the GROUP BY
// for the scan to stay ordered *and* covering; a single timestamp-leading index
// covers the columns but the planner won't take it for a GROUP BY (it would owe
// a sort), so it falls back to the table probe. Kept alongside the narrow
// indexes, which still win the plain `col = ?` point lookups elsewhere.

/**
 * One scanner per database file — enforced in the file, not by hoping.
 *
 * The transcript scanner is the one writer here that is NOT idempotent: its
 * events carry `event_id: null`, so the idempotency index above
 * (`WHERE event_id IS NOT NULL`) cannot see, let alone drop, a line ingested
 * twice. Two server processes on one file therefore inflate event counts,
 * tokens and dollars in silence — nothing errors, the totals just grow.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. Measured on this machine's own 354 MB history on
 * 2026-08-07: 22 duplicate groups, 22 extra rows out of 100,354 scanner events.
 * Small, and that is exactly why it went unnoticed for so long. Measured in the
 * lab with two real processes racing one live tail: 4 appended turns became 5
 * events and 5,000 input tokens instead of 4,000.
 *
 * It is easy to reach: `defaultDbPath()` resolves to the XDG data dir, so any
 * checkout runs its scanner over the real history. The README's
 * "attaches, never duplicates" only fires on a `:4000` port collision, and a
 * second server started on another port on purpose sails straight past it.
 *
 * So the second process is held off here: the claim row names a pid and a port,
 * and whoever finds a LIVE claim that is not theirs runs with the scanner
 * disabled (see `startScanner`). Everything else it does — serving, hook ingest,
 * git, the terminal — is unaffected, and hook ingest is idempotent anyway.
 *
 * A stale claim must never lock anyone out: this app is SIGKILLed routinely
 * (the desktop shell kills its sidecar, `pkill` during development), so the row
 * regularly outlives its process. `holderAlive` is what decides, and it is
 * deliberately three checks deep because a bare `kill(pid, 0)` is wrong twice
 * over — pids are reused after a reboot and after wraparound.

 * IS and has nowhere to put a reminder; we own when to speak, which is also the
 * part that must keep working when Taskwarrior is absent, unconfigured, or
 * being written to by an editor at the same moment. task_uuid is nullable and
 * first-class: a reminder with no task behind it is a legitimate thing to want.
 *
 * title is a snapshot, not a join. It must be possible to fire a reminder on
 * a machine where the task list cannot be read at all — and a notification that
 * says "reminder about (unavailable)" is worse than none.
 *
 * civil + zone rather than an instant alone, because "Monday 9:00" is a
 * civil time. Fixing it to an epoch at creation fires it an hour wrong on the
 * far side of a daylight-saving change — twice a year, for anyone in Europe.
 * due is the resolved cache, recomputed when the two disagree.
 *
 * fired_at is the ledger. It is written inside the claim, before any delivery
 * is attempted: a crash between claim and send costs one missed ping, and the
 * other order costs a duplicate. A missed ping sits red on screen until
 * acknowledged; a duplicate at three in the morning is an uninstall.

 * The understudy — what he would have done, and how often that matched.
 *
 * Four tables, created in one block, and the shape has to be right the first
 * time. This file has no migration system: it versions itself with CREATE TABLE
 * IF NOT EXISTS for anything new and an ad-hoc `try { ALTER TABLE … } catch {}`
 * for a column added later, which works for one column and degrades badly for a
 * table whose columns are the record. A rename here cannot be expressed at all,
 * so every column below is either one the scorecard reads today or one whose
 * absence would make an already-written row unreadable later.
 *
 * What the ledger is NOT is the thing worth stating first. It holds no request
 * body, no prompt, no keystroke and no free text. `subject` is an identifier —
 * a pull request number, a branch name, a pane id — and `predicted`/`actual`
 * are JSON of CATEGORICAL decisions: which branch pattern, which cwd, which of
 * the offered findings were rejected. That is enough to score agreement and not
 * enough to reconstruct what he was working on, which is the trade the whole
 * feature is built around. A ledger that kept the bodies would be a second copy
 * of everything sensitive in the product, in a table with a longer retention
 * than the events it was derived from.
 *
 * `sealed_at` and `situation_hash` are the reason the numbers mean anything.
 * The situation is hashed and written synchronously BEFORE he can answer it, so
 * a prediction can never be fitted to an answer already known. A prediction
 * that lands after his answer is kept with `late = 1` rather than dropped —
 * dropping late rows would quietly select for the situations that were easy to
 * predict fast — and an actual that arrives with no seal in front of it sets
 * `unsealed = 1`, which is counted against trigger recall instead of being
 * scored as a hit it never earned.
 *
 * `provenance` is what makes `n` honest: only `typed` and `clicked` count
 * toward a class's denominator. `agent-tolerated` is an agent not objecting,
 * which is not the user agreeing, and counting it would let the understudy
 * grade its own homework.
 *
 * `kind` splits the rows by how long they are worth keeping. A `stub` is the
 * bare fact that a write happened — route, actor, status — and it ages out at
 * ninety days. A `decision` (a prediction scored against an actual) and a
 * `fence` (a refusal, a halt) are the record itself and are never deleted.

 *

 * It used to be `if (cache) return cache`, dropped in the prune, on the stated

 * chart — not wrong by a row, absent. The days that vanish are exactly the ones
 * the rollup exists for: the old ones, whose events are gone, so nothing else
 * can put them back.
 *
 * It surfaced under `bun test`, which shares one process across suites. A suite
 * that read the rollup while it was empty warmed the cache for every suite
 * after it, and a suite that then wrote its own rows directly — a fixture, not
 * a prune — was invisible to its own scope. Green for months, then red on an
 * unchanged commit when the runner's file order changed. The assumption was
 * load-bearing and undocumented at the call sites that broke it.
 *
 * So the cache is validated instead of trusted. COUNT(*) with MAX(rowid) is one

 * past it. So the memo keeps every flag with where its edit ran.

 * session from 0 in one go, and spreading that over several polls is the next
 * step and is not here. The per-session cap applies before the scope, so a
