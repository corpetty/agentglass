/**
 * Which worktree the agent in a tmux pane is working in.
 *
 * The panel already claimed to answer this and the answer was a scrape: read
 * the focused pane's xterm buffer, look for a worktree's folder name, take the
 * most recent one. Measured against a live fleet of five agents it found
 * nothing at all, and for four reasons no amount of tuning removes.
 *
 *   * **The name is not on screen.** The agent whose whole session was inside a
 *     worktree had zero occurrences of that worktree's folder anywhere in its
 *     pane — and so did the other four.
 *   * **There is no scrollback to widen the search to.** An agent TUI runs on
 *     the alternate screen, so tmux keeps no history for it (`history_size` 0,
 *     `alternate_on` 1) and neither does the terminal above it. "The last 250
 *     lines" is, in practice, the sixty rows currently drawn.
 *   * **The paths are in the folded parts.** Of 129 mentions of the worktree in
 *     that session's transcript, 2 were in prose. The rest were tool inputs —
 *     68 Bash commands, 6 Writes, 5 Edits — and the CLI draws those collapsed
 *     as "Ran 3 shell commands".
 *   * **And they were hours old.** The last one was printed at 09:28 and the
 *     screen was read at 11:37.
 *
 * The cwd is no better on its own, which is what sent the first attempt to the
 * screen in the first place: every process in that pane — fish, the CLI, its
 * MCP servers, its shells — reported the PARENT repo, because an agent reaches
 * into a worktree with `git -C` and absolute paths without ever moving.
 *
 * So this asks the two places that hold the answer as a fact rather than as
 * pixels:
 *
 *   * **the agent's own working directory**, for the agents that were started
 *     inside the worktree. /proc, an equality test, nothing parsed. The first
 *     attempt never covered this case either.
 *   * **the transcript it is writing**, for the ones that were not. Same file
 *     the CLI itself renders from, read from the tail: the structured tool
 *     inputs the screen folds away are all there.
 *
 * Only tool *inputs* — what the agent asked for — never tool results. That is
 * not tidiness: one `git worktree list` puts all 22 worktrees in the output at
 * the same instant, and a reader that counted those would answer with whichever
 * one it happened to see first, confidently and at random.
 *
 * The pane → transcript link is a fact too, and it comes from the hook.
 * agentglass's own send_event.py runs as a child of the agent, so it inherits
 * that pane's TMUX_PANE and every tool call now says where it came from. The
 * obvious shortcut does not work and was tried: `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` is in
 * the environment of every child, but it is the id the process LAUNCHED with,
 * and on a session that has been resumed it names a transcript that does not
 * exist — measured on the one session this was written against.

/**
 * One row per pane OF ONE TMUX SERVER: the key is the pane id and the server
 * together ("<socket path>,<server pid>", as the hook reads it out of $TMUX,
 * or "" from a hook that does not say).
 *
 * The pane id alone is not a pane. Every tmux server hands out `%0, %1…`,
 * the engine and the person's own tmux both run Claude, and hooks fire from
 * both — so keyed by the id alone, whichever server's `%2` fired last owned
 * the row. The restore sets another server's note aside, which left the
 * engine's agent photographed with only what its argv carried: nothing for a
 * Claude started fresh (a shell at the next boot, its conversation orphaned),
 * and the old id for a restored one that had `/clear`ed since (the conversation
 * it had left resumed at the next boot). A reboot is the same thing in time
 * rather than space: the new server hands the dead one's ids out again, under
 * a new pid.
 *
 * A NEW TABLE, NOT THE OLD ONE REBUILT. `pane_agent` is keyed by the id
 * alone, and every build before this one prepares `ON CONFLICT(pane_id)`
 * against it when it loads: rebuilt with a two-column key, SQLite refuses
 * that statement, so an older build installed afterwards could not start,
 * and one still running would fail every hook it was sent (both measured on
 * a copy of the table). So `pane_note` is created beside it, brought up to
 * date from it at every start, and `pane_agent` is left for whichever older
 * build still writes it.
 *
 * Ceiling: the pid is a server's name for its life, not forever — a server
 * after a reboot can draw the pid of the one before it. Its row then carries
 * the dead server's note until its own hook fires, and the restore tells the
 * two apart by time (`noteIsThisAgents`), as it did before the server was in
 * the key.
 *
 * Exported so the migration can be run against a database built by hand.
