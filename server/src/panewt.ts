/**
 * Which worktree the agent in a tmux pane is working in.
 *
 * The panel already claimed to answer this and the answer was a scrape: read
 * the focused pane's xterm buffer, look for a worktree's folder name, take the
 * most recent one. Measured against a live fleet of five agents it found
 * nothing at all, and for four reasons no amount of tuning removes.
 *
 *   * **The name is not on screen.** The agent whose whole session was inside a
 *     worktree had zero occurrences of that worktree's folder anywhere in its
 *     pane — and so did the other four.
 *   * **There is no scrollback to widen the search to.** An agent TUI runs on
 *     the alternate screen, so tmux keeps no history for it (`history_size` 0,
 *     `alternate_on` 1) and neither does the terminal above it. "The last 250
 *     lines" is, in practice, the sixty rows currently drawn.
 *   * **The paths are in the folded parts.** Of 129 mentions of the worktree in
 *     that session's transcript, 2 were in prose. The rest were tool inputs —
 *     68 Bash commands, 6 Writes, 5 Edits — and the CLI draws those collapsed
 *     as "Ran 3 shell commands".
 *   * **And they were hours old.** The last one was printed at 09:28 and the
 *     screen was read at 11:37.
 *
 * The cwd is no better on its own, which is what sent the first attempt to the
 * screen in the first place: every process in that pane — fish, the CLI, its
 * MCP servers, its shells — reported the PARENT repo, because an agent reaches
 * into a worktree with `git -C` and absolute paths without ever moving.
 *
 * So this asks the two places that hold the answer as a fact rather than as
 * pixels:
 *
 *   * **the agent's own working directory**, for the agents that were started
 *     inside the worktree. /proc, an equality test, nothing parsed. The first
 *     attempt never covered this case either.
 *   * **the transcript it is writing**, for the ones that were not. Same file
 *     the CLI itself renders from, read from the tail: the structured tool
 *     inputs the screen folds away are all there.
 *
 * Only tool *inputs* — what the agent asked for — never tool results. That is
 * not tidiness: one `git worktree list` puts all 22 worktrees in the output at
 * the same instant, and a reader that counted those would answer with whichever
 * one it happened to see first, confidently and at random.
 *
 * The pane → transcript link is a fact too, and it comes from the hook.
 * agentglass's own send_event.py runs as a child of the agent, so it inherits
 * that pane's TMUX_PANE and every tool call now says where it came from. The
 * obvious shortcut does not work and was tried: `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` is in
 * the environment of every child, but it is the id the process LAUNCHED with,
 * and on a session that has been resumed it names a transcript that does not
 * exist — measured on the one session this was written against.
