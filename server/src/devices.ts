/**
 * A credential per device, instead of one password for the machine.
 *
 * What this replaces: scanning the QR in Settings ▸ Remote access handed the
 * phone `AGENTGLASS_TOKEN` itself — the machine's single shared secret, with
 * no expiry, no identity and no way to take it back from one device. Three
 * things followed from that, and all three are the reason this file exists.
 *
 * *Anyone who saw the screen was paired.* The QR carried the credential, so a
 * photograph of it across a room was a working key. It carries a pairing
 * ticket now (see pairing.ts) and the credential is only ever minted after
 * somebody at the machine accepts.
 *
 * *A lost phone could not be cut off.* One token meant revoking was rotating,
 * and rotating kicked every device including the desk. Each device has its own
 * now, and forgetting one leaves the others alone.
 *
 * *Everything could do everything.* A phone that only ever answers gates had
 * git write, docker control and the terminal, because there was only one level
 * of access and it was "all of it".
 *
 * The token itself is never stored. What is on disk is a SHA-256 of it, so a
 * readable file is not a working key — the same reason a password file holds
 * hashes. It is checked in constant time, because a comparison that returns
 * early leaks the prefix.
