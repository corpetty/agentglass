 * seats is handed a rule to narrate `Goal: … Next: …` into its own output.
 * Scraping a tmux pane for that text does not work here — panewt.ts measured
 * it against a live fleet and found nothing (no scrollback on the alternate
 * screen, the paths folded into collapsed tool calls). What works is asking
 * directly, through the same channel the memory-save reminder already uses
 * successfully: the hook's stdout on a prompt.
 *
 * The session id is baked in so the answer can be tied back to this hook —
 * the agent does not know its own id, and the reminder is the one moment
 * that knows both. `$PWD` is left to the shell that runs it: it is the one
 * thing here the server should not guess.
