/*
 * The understudy: it watches, it guesses, it is scored, and — once a class has
 * earned it — it acts inside a bounded shift and can be wound back.
 *
 * Everything in this file exists to make one number honest — "how often would
 * it have done what he did" — and the whole design is downstream of the two
 * ways that number can be a lie.
 *
 * THE FIRST LIE is fitting the guess to the answer. If a prediction may be
 * written after the decision is already visible, the score measures nothing
 * except the order the code happened to run in. So the situation is HASHED AND
 * SEALED synchronously, before the user can answer it: `sealSituation` writes
 * its row and returns before the route it was called from does anything else.
 * A prediction that lands after his answer is kept anyway, with `late = 1`,
 * because dropping it would quietly select for the situations that were easy to
 * predict fast — the class would look sharp precisely where it was slow.
 *
 * THE SECOND LIE is a denominator full of things nobody agreed with. Only
 * `typed` and `clicked` provenance counts toward a class's `n`. An agent not
 * objecting is not the user agreeing, and an actual that arrives with no seal in
 * front of it is recorded with `unsealed = 1` rather than scored, because those
 * are the rows that flatter a score by pretending a trigger fired when it did
 * not. The unsealed count is the trigger-recall denominator, so it has to be
 * honest even though it is the number that makes us look worst.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE, and this is the part worth stating first. No request body,
 * no prompt, no keystroke, no free text. `subject` is an identifier — a pull
 * request number, a branch, a pane id — and `predicted`/`actual` are JSON of
 * CATEGORICAL decisions: which branch pattern, which cwd, which of the offered
 * findings were rejected. That is enough to score agreement and not enough to
 * reconstruct what he was working on, which is the trade the whole feature is
 * built around.
 *
 * WHY THE PRIVATE-TERMS GATE LIVES IN THIS FILE rather than at ingest: v1
 * ingests nothing at all, and `sealSituation` is the only path in the server
 * that ever writes raw screen text into an understudy table. Putting the gate
 * anywhere else would be putting it somewhere the text does not go. The gate
 * returns a term INDEX and never the term, so a failing test of it is safe to
 * paste into a public issue — which matters, because this repository is public
 * and the terms file it reads is exactly the list of things that must not
 * appear in it.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE ACTS. There is no writer that launches an agent, answers a gate,
 * merges anything or touches a card. `setMode` cannot lift a class above
 * `UNDERSTUDY_CEILING`, which is `shadow`, and being OFFERED a promotion is not
 * being promoted: a human presses, or nothing happens.
 *
 * EVERY WRITE IS GUARDED and every write swallows its own failure. The
 * understudy must never break the thing it is watching — the merge already
 * happened, and throwing after it is a worse outcome than a missing row — so
 * each writer is wrapped and each returns a falsy id rather than propagating.
