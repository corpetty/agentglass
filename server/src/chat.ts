 * completely, and two of its fields are execution: `mode:"bypassPermissions"`
 * becomes `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, and `allowedTools:["Bash"]` reaches
 * the same place one tool at a time with the bypass switched off. Both were
 * measured from a device holding nothing but `answer`, against a server with
 * the gate live — the argv that came out was
 *
 *   -p --output-format stream-json --verbose --model claude-opus-5 --dangerously-skip-permissions
 *   -p --output-format stream-json --verbose --model claude-opus-5 --permission-mode default --allowedTools Bash Write Edit
 *
 * in the workspace root, which the same device reads off `/projects` with the
 * `read` half of its scope. On the machine this was found on, that directory
 * was the owner's employer's repository. `/terminal/pty` is carefully held at
 * `full` by FULL_GET so a phone cannot open a shell; this walked around it with
 * an agent that needs no shell of its own.
 *
 * So the scope decides, not the body. Anything short of `full` gets the
 * prompting default and no pre-approved tools, and has to name a session that
 * already exists — "replying to a session that is already running" is exactly
 * what the phone's settings screen promises `answer` means, and a turn with no
 * `resumeId` is not a reply, it is a new unattended agent.
 *
 * The desk is unaffected: it holds the machine's token, so it is `full`, and so
 * is a caller on a server with no token configured at all (there are no device
 * credentials in that world, and the bind is loopback — see index.ts).
