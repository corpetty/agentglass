/**
 * Letting an agent drive the built-in browser.
 *
 * The point is the logins. An agent can already fetch a URL from its shell and
 * get the signed-out version of everything that matters — the dashboard, the
 * staging app, the ticket — because the session lives in a browser and not in
 * `curl`. This app has a browser with those sessions in it, sitting in a pane,
 * and until now nothing outside the window could reach it.
 *
 * Which makes this a relay, not a driver. The page lives in a guest process
 * inside the desktop shell; the only thing that can touch it is the panel it is
 * mounted in. So an agent's HTTP request is parked here, handed to that panel
 * over the socket every window already holds, and answered when the panel says
 * what happened. The alternative — a second browser, driven headlessly, holding
 * its own copy of somebody's cookies — is the thing this deliberately is not.
 *
 * Three consequences worth stating rather than discovering:
 *
 *   * **It needs the window open.** A request with nobody listening fails
 *     quickly and says so, rather than hanging until the agent's own timeout
 *     and reading as "the browser is broken".
 *   * **Every operation is a closed verb**, not a script. `click` takes a
 *     selector; there is no "run this JavaScript". The panel implements each
 *     one, so the set of things reachable through this door is the set someone
 *     wrote down here — which is the same rule the terminal's command paths and
 *     the tmux control surface already follow.
 *   * **Every request is bounded.** A page that never settles must not hold a
 *     socket, a pending map entry and an agent's turn open forever.
 */

 * the CLI I drive only has open/read/click/type/wait/shot/text/back/forward/
 * scroll/press — there is no verb for switching tab, and `open` replaces the
 * current view. So I move the agent's side outside the browser."
 *
 * That is a real cost and it was ours: the panel has tabs, grouped into
 * folders, with profiles under them — and none of it was addressable. An
 * agent comparing two pages had to choose between losing the first one and
 * leaving the browser altogether.
 *
 *   tabs      what is open, with the active one marked
 *   tab       switch to one by index or by id
 *   newtab    open a URL in a NEW tab rather than over the current one
 *   closetab  close one
 *
 * `open` keeps replacing the current view, because that is what every
 * existing script expects it to do and changing it silently would be worse
 * than not having tabs at all.

/* -- who made this container, and when was it last used ----------------------
 *
 * §13. MINTING A CONTAINER AND JOINING ONE SOMEBODY ELSE MADE ARE THE SAME
 * GESTURE, with no signal on either side.
 *
 * `profiles` answered a flat list of bare names, so an agent following this
 * tool's own etiquette — "drop yours when the work is done" — could destroy a
 * live peer's container by name collision and be told `ok: true`. The panel
 * resolves a container by NAME against a machine-wide list and mints only when
 * the name is absent, so `open --as pol` is "make me one" or "join theirs"
 * depending on a fact the caller cannot see.
 *
 * A profile record in the panel is `{id, name}`: ownership is not modelled
 * anywhere, and modelling it there would put it behind React state this relay
 * cannot read. So it is modelled HERE, at the one seam every agent's request
 * already passes through, and keyed exactly the way the container namespace is
 * keyed: by bare name, machine-wide. Deliberately NOT namespaced per session —
 * §13's own reasoning: the containers themselves are machine-global, so
 * per-session keys would hand out separate TABS inside a container two sessions
 * still share, which is isolation in the answer and none in the cookie jar.
 *
 * FIRST WRITER WINS. Whoever names a container while it does not yet exist is
 * its creator; later users only move `lastSeenMs`. A container that predates
 * this ledger has `creator: null`, which reads as "unknown" and is allowed with
 * a warning rather than refused — otherwise shipping this strands every
 * container already on disk, which §13 rules out by name.

 * directory named on purpose for one server's state is already dedicated. The
 * refutation is four hundred lines down this same file. `auditLogPath()` writes
 * `$AGENTGLASS_STATE_DIR/browser-audit.log`, so with the variable set, the two
 * halves of this browser's state landed in different places:
 *
 *     ledger   $STATE/agentglass/browser-containers.json
 *     audit    $STATE/browser-audit.log
 *
 * and a probe or a second server pointed at a scratch directory found one of
 * them and not the other. Four other readers of this variable already treat it
 * this way — `auditLogPath`, `cloneClaudeHome`, and `db.ts`, which gives it a
 * branch of its own; `tasks.ts` and `tmuxbin.ts` append a name of their own
 * (`task`, `tmux`) rather than the app's. This was the only one that did not.
 *
 * AND THE FALLBACK IS THE STATE DIRECTORY, not the config one.
 *
 * Fixing the variable left the two files still apart on a machine that does not
 * set it: this read `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` while `auditLogPath` reads
 * `XDG_STATE_HOME`, so the pair landed in `~/.config/agentglass/` and
 * `~/.local/state/agentglass/`. The ledger is not configuration — nobody edits
 * it, nothing reads it to decide behaviour, and it is rewritten by the app every
 * time a container is made. It is a record of what happened, which is what a
 * state directory is for, and `~/.local/state/agentglass/` on this machine
 * already holds `browser-audit.log`, `clone-claude/`, `tmux/` and `tmux.conf`.
 *
 * Measured before moving it: `~/.config/agentglass/` holds no browser file at
 * all here, so on this machine there is nothing to move. `legacyLedgerFile`

 *     starting the CLI process   68.7 ms
 *     one HTTP call inside it    11.0 ms
 *
 * A persistent transport removes the second one and not the first — an agent
 * runs one process per verb, so it pays the 68.7 ms whatever the transport is.
 * `do` removes the first, for every verb after the first in a batch: six verbs
 * went from 618 ms to 94 ms, which is 86% of what was there to take.
 *
 * What would remain is 11 ms per verb, for a caller that keeps a process
 * alive, in exchange for a daemon, a reconnect story, and a second code path
 * for every verb. That is not worth it today. If an agent ever holds a process
 * open across many verbs, the number changes and so should this decision — the
 * measurement is here so it can be re-taken rather than re-argued.
 */

/**
 * Several verbs, one call — spec §1, the first item on his own list by return.

 * the panel is on top of that. The interaction the spec describes — click,
 * wait for the network to go quiet, look at what changed — is three of those,
 * and a real repro is six or more. That is most of a second spent on process
 * startup, per interaction, all day.
 *
 * The steps run in order and stop at the first failure, because a sequence is
 * a sequence: `type` into a field that `click` never opened is not a second
 * result, it is noise on top of the first error. The failed step keeps its own
 * §15 diagnosis, so the answer to "why did this stop" arrives with it rather
 * than needing another call — which would put back exactly what this removes.
 *
 * EVERY STEP GOES THROUGH `parseAsk`, and that is not an implementation
 * detail: the origin allow-list and read-only mode from §16 live in there. A
 * batch verb that validated once and then ran freely would be a way to ask the
 * browser for things the guardrails refuse — the guardrail would still be

 * HTTP round trip, and — the part that actually costs — another answer parked
 * in the agent's context for the rest of the session, which §14 measures at
 * 82.7% of what an agent spends.
 *
 * A true duplex transport would have the browser push. Short of rebuilding
 * the transport, this moves the polling to the side where it is nearly free:
 * the server already holds the connection to the panel, so it can ask every
 * 250ms for as long as the caller is willing to wait and answer the moment
 * something is there. One call, one answer, one entry in the context — and
 * from where the agent stands it is indistinguishable from being pushed to.
 *
 * It answers with an empty list rather than an error when the wait runs out.
