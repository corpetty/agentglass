/*
 * The user's half of the "Review with Claude" menu.
 *
 * `reviewRecipes.ts` holds the catalogue — the prompts we ship. This holds what
 * somebody did to it: a built-in whose wording they rewrote, a built-in they
 * deleted, and the ones they wrote themselves. Two files rather than one
 * because they age differently: the catalogue improves with the app, and an
 * edit must survive that improvement without freezing a copy of everything else
 * beside it.
 *
 * Stored by id, next to commands.json and clickup-views.json, and for the same
 * reason: it is a handful of strings, it is not a secret, and being able to open
 * it in an editor beats any storage engine.
 *
 * Nothing here executes anything. A prompt is text that reaches an agent, which
 * is a real thing to be careful about — but the care belongs where the agent is
 * launched, not here, and pretending otherwise would only stop somebody writing
 * the word `rm` in a sentence about a diff.
