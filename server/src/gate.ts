// pending tool call; agentglass holds it open until a human approves/denies from
// the dashboard (or a timeout auto-allows). This is the remote for the fleet.
//
// Safety: default-allow on timeout, and the hook exits 0 (allow) if agentglass
// is unreachable — the control plane never blocks agents by accident.
//
// Durability: every request is written to SQLite on arrival and updated when it
// resolves. A restart re-hydrates the still-live ones (see restoreGates), so a
// crash no longer turns "waiting for a human" into a silent auto-allow, and the
// held connection is no longer the only place a pending request exists — a hook
// whose connection dropped can re-attach with awaitGate(id).
