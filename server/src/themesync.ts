//   * uninstalling is deleting one line, not restoring a backup.
//
// A config manager would be a bigger feature and a much worse trade: replacing
// somebody's editor config is the most destructive thing this app could do, and
// it would put our update cycle in a fight with their local edits forever.

   * tmux: cheap and safe — sourcing a file it already sources is a no-op if

   * environment: `Bun.spawn` hands the child the environment the process
   * started with, so a test that sets TMUX_TMPDIR and deletes TMUX at runtime
   * changes nothing about the tmux it spawns. That is how a "Light" fixture
   * reached a developer's own session and painted every pane white.
   *
   * Three gates, and they cover three different processes — none of them is a
   * restatement of another:
   *
   *   `isTest()`            the suite running in `bun test`'s own process.
   *                         Live, not a module const: frozen at import it
   *                         answered for the whole process, and this file's
   *                         paths were already fixed for exactly that.
   *   `tmuxSocketAllowed`   the same rule `tmux()` applies, rather than a
   *                         second private copy of a rule that has now been
   *                         wrong three times. This spawn bypasses `tmux()`, so
   *                         `tmux()`'s backstop never saw it.
   *   `tmuxSocketConfined`  the server spawned as a CHILD with a named
   *                         environment, where NODE_ENV is absent and the two
   *                         above are therefore blind. TMUX_TMPDIR is the only
   *                         signal that survives that spawn.
   *
   * A bare `tmux`, so it goes wherever a bare `tmux` goes — the socket `$TMUX`
   * names, or /tmp/tmux-<uid>/default. Until today the only thing stopping it
   * was that these suites point XDG_CONFIG_HOME at a scratch directory, making
   * `existsSync(TMUX_THEME)` false a few lines up: a coincidence, not a guard,
   * and one that ends the moment a suite themes something for its own reasons.
