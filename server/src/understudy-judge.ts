/*
 * Judgement, for the cases the tables decline.
 *
 * Everything else here is counting. Counting answers "what did he do the last
 * nine times this exact shape came up" and it answers it well — the backtest
 * puts C3 at ninety per cent against a fifty per cent baseline. What counting
 * cannot do is generalise: a situation nobody has classified, a card written
 * this morning, a shape seen twice. For those the tables correctly decline, and
 * declining forever is not standing in for somebody.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS AND WHAT IT IS NOT. It is a reader, not an actor. It is invoked
 * with NO TOOLS AT ALL — the argv carries an empty allowlist and a permission
 * mode that prompts, and there is no terminal to prompt at, so a tool call
 * cannot succeed even if one were attempted. Text goes in, a verdict comes out.
 * It cannot read a file, run a command, or reach the network on its own account.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS GIVEN. Only material that has already been through the
 * private-terms gate on its way into the bank — the rules and precedents this
 * person allowed, already translated. Not the raw files, not the paths, not the
 * transcripts. The prompt is assembled here so that what leaves is exactly what
 * this file put in it and can be read in one screen.
 *
 * AND IT IS OFF BY DEFAULT. The counting predictor runs entirely on this
 * machine; this one sends a prompt to a model. He uses that same channel by
 * hand every day, which is why it is the channel chosen rather than some new
 * service with a new key — but him typing into it and this app doing so on his
 * behalf while he is away are different acts, and the second one is his to
 * switch on.

 * Where the judge runs, and it is not /tmp.
 *
 * The working directory was /tmp, on the reasoning that somewhere with nothing
 * in it gives a stray tool attempt nothing to find. The reasoning was about the
 * repository and missed the CLI: Claude Code reads from its working directory
 * before the prompt arrives — `CLAUDE.md` into the context, `.claude/settings.json`
 * for hooks (each one a shell command it runs for you), `.mcp.json` for tool
 * servers. /tmp is world-writable. Any other account on the machine could drop
 * those three files there and have every judgement run its hook, or read its
 * instructions, with "no tools" doing nothing about it because a hook is not a
 * tool call.
 *
 * So each call gets a directory of its own, mode 0700, under this app's state
 * dir — the same base understudy-pane.ts uses for the clone's config — made
 * with mkdtemp so two judgements never share one, and removed when the answer
 * is in. Nothing else can write there and nothing is there to read.
 *
 * `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is pointed at a private directory too, for the reason
 * understudy-pane.ts measured: his own config carries fourteen kinds of hook,
 * every one of which fired on a run that is not a conversation with him. NOT
 * an empty one, though — the credential lives in that directory, and an
 * empty config dir on an install signed in through the browser is a judge
 * that cannot answer. The credential file is symlinked, exactly as the pane
 * does it, so a token he rotates is rotated here and there is no second copy.
 * The directory is stable across calls (a symlink, not a session), while the
 * cwd is per call.
