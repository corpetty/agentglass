 * folder's root it never climbs above it. That is a reading of the text: a
 * link through another link (`up -> .`, then `up/up/../<name>/x`) can still
 * spell its way out and back in. What stops that one is the physical check
 * above, run on a staging folder whose name nobody can guess; a check that
 * walks a folder with a fixed name, as the catalogue's do, does not see it,
