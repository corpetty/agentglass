// already have nvim open — very likely inside the tmux session in the panel
// next door — with your undo history, your marks and your LSP warmed up.
// Starting a second one there is worse than not opening anything.
//
// So: talk to the running one if there is one, and only fall back to spawning.
//
// Neovim makes this cheap. Every instance since 0.9 listens on a unix socket at
// $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/nvim.<pid>.0 without being asked, and `--server <sock>
// --remote-send` drives it. No plugin, no config, nothing for the user to set
// up — which matters, because a feature that needs setup is a feature nobody
// turns on.
