// Linked worktrees are the project on another branch — not projects of their own.
//
// The everyday layout this exists for is a repo with a dozen sibling checkouts:
//
//   ~/code/orbit                 (main)
//   ~/code/orbit-WEB-1042        (worktree, branch WEB-1042-retry-failed-uploads)
//   ~/code/orbit-WEB-1188        (worktree, branch WEB-1188-quota-banner-copy)
//
// Nothing about those paths says they belong together — they're siblings, so a
// prefix test on `~/code/orbit` matches none of them. That single fact broke the
// app in two directions at once. The picker swept the folder, found a `.git` in
// each, and listed thirteen "projects" where the user has one. And having opened
// `orbit`, the terminal, git writes and chat all refused to run in any of those
// checkouts — "outside the open project" — even though the git panel happily
// listed them as worktrees of the very project that was open.
//
// So: one place that answers "is this a linked worktree, and what family does it
// belong to", used by scope enforcement, repo discovery and session labelling
// alike. Two answers, deliberately different in cost:
//
//   worktreeParent() — one stat + one small read, no subprocess. Cheap enough to
//     call per candidate during a directory sweep of hundreds of folders.
//   worktreeFamily() — a real `git worktree list`, cached. Authoritative, and
//     the only way to go from the main repo *down* to its checkouts.
//
// Kept dependency-free (node + Bun only) on purpose: config.ts consults it from
// inScope(), and config.ts sits below everything else in the import graph.

 * A normal checkout has a `.git` **directory**; a linked worktree has a `.git`
 * **file** holding `gitdir: /path/to/main/.git/worktrees/<name>`. That marker is
 * the whole detection, and it survives a worktree whose registration git has
 * since forgotten (a stale `prune`), which is exactly when a subprocess answer
 * would come back empty.
 *
 * Returns null for a main checkout, a non-repo, and — importantly — a
 * *submodule*, whose `.git` is also a file but points at `.git/modules/<name>`.
 * A submodule is genuinely a different repository, so it must keep being listed
 * on its own.
