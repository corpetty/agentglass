 * The copies this server writes for something to LOOK at, and the one place
 * that knows where they live.
 *
 * Two things need a file on disk that the workspace does not have: a pull
 * request's version of a file, fetched from GitHub at its head commit, and a
 * branch's version, read out of the object store. Both are read-only snapshots,
 * both go under the system temp directory, and both are opened in the editor by
 * the PTY — which has to admit them without admitting `/tmp` in general.
 *
 * It exists because that admission was a string literal, twice, in a different
 * file from the two that write the directories. Adding the second kind of copy
 * therefore produced a pane with a SHELL in it: the path was not in scope and
 * did not match the one prefix `terminal.ts` knew, so it fell back exactly as
 * its comment promises — "silently viewing a different file is worse than
 * viewing none". Correct behaviour, missing registration.
 *
 * So the only way to make one of these directories is the function whose set
 * the check reads. A third kind cannot forget to tell the terminal about itself.
