/*
 * The boards you work from, and the last thing each of them said.
 *
 * Two jobs in one file because they share a lifetime: a saved view is useless
 * without somewhere to put what it returned, and a cached page is meaningless
 * once its view is gone.
 *
 * Kept beside the config rather than in the database. Views are a handful of
 * short strings that a person would reasonably want to read, edit or delete
 * with an editor — the same argument `config.json` already makes for itself —
 * and the cache next to them is disposable by definition. Neither is a secret:
 * the token lives in credentials.json and nothing here touches it.
 *
 * The cache is on disk rather than in memory for one reason, and it is the
 * reason the whole feature is worth having: reading a view takes a second and a
 * half, and the app is restarted often. In memory, every restart pays that
 * again and the panel opens empty; on disk, it opens with what you last saw and
 * corrects itself a second later. Stale by a few minutes beats blank.
