/*
 * Finding a file that is not in any checkout.
 *
 * The finder answers three questions about the repository you are working in,
 * and there was a fourth it kept sending people out of the app to answer:
 * "where is that document". The evidence folder for a ticket, the note in
 * ~/Documents, the export somebody dropped in ~/Downloads — none of them live
 * in a git checkout, so none of them were reachable, and reading one meant
 * leaving for a file manager and coming back to find your place again. Which
 * is the exact trip the palette exists to remove.
 *
 * Everything else under /files/ is bounded by the open project on purpose (see
 * config.ts): a cockpit pointed at one repository must not hand out reads of
 * the whole machine through a different door. This is the deliberate
 * exception, and it is narrow on purpose:
 *
 *   HOME, and nothing above it   Your own documents, not the machine's. Extra
 *                                roots exist for the person whose work lives
 *                                on another mount — but they are named by the
 *                                operator, not discovered.
 *   nothing hidden               A dotted path component is where credentials
 *                                live: ~/.ssh, ~/.aws, ~/.config/<app>,
 *                                ~/.claude/.credentials.json. The rule is the
 *                                dot rather than a list of names, because a
 *                                list is only ever as good as the last app
 *                                that was installed. Anybody who genuinely
 *                                wants a dotfile has a shell one chord away.
 *   symlinks resolved first      Otherwise ~/shortcut-to-etc walks around both
 *                                of the rules above while looking like a
 *                                folder in your home directory.
 *   its own switch               AGENTGLASS_DISK_DISABLED=1. Same reasoning as
 *                                fsbrowse.ts: an operator who turned directory
 *                                browsing off has given something up
 *                                deliberately, and must not get it back
 *                                sideways because a new tab appeared.
 *
 * Measured on this machine before any of it was written: `fd` over a home
 * directory answers a query matching NOTHING in 0.19s — every file walked,
 * nothing found — and a query that does match stops earlier still. So there is
 * no index here and no cache: the walk is cheaper than the bookkeeping to
 * avoid it would be.
