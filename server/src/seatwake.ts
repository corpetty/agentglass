/*
 * WAKING THE SEAT — on what changed, not on a clock.
 *
 * The version of this post that was run by hand woke every twenty minutes and
 * re-read a field nobody had touched: of fourteen rounds in one afternoon,
 * twelve said "no change". Each of those is a turn, a context, and a bill, to
 * learn that nothing happened — and the app already knew nothing had happened,
 * because `lanternwatch.tick()` had just read the same board for free.
 *
 * So the seat has no clock of its own (its prompt says so in as many words).
 * This module rides the watch that already runs: after each look it compares
 * what the field says needs a person with what it said last time, and prompts
 * the seat ONLY when that changed. A floor underneath — `seatWakeHours` — wakes
 * it anyway now and then, so a quiet day still gets a line rather than silence
 * that cannot be told from a dead agent.
 *
 * What is compared is the FINDINGS, not the board: an agent moving from one
 * file to the next changes the board every few seconds and changes nothing a
 * person needs to know. What changes a finding is somebody stopping, somebody
 * going quiet for an hour, or a window vanishing.

     *
     * The other half is reachability, and it was measured the hard way. An
     * agent finished its task, its owner closed the tmux window, and an hour
     * later the seat was woken with "said it was on … and has been quiet for
     * 1h — done, or stuck?" about a pane that no longer exists. The seat's
     * only move on a forgotten agent is to nudge it, and there is nothing to
     * nudge: an agent that has no pane on this machine cannot be reached,
     * whether it died or is alive on another tmux server.
     *
     * The finding itself is NOT dropped — the Lantern still shows David that a
     * claim went quiet, which is his to read and is a different question from
     * whether it is worth waking the most expensive context on the machine.
     * Somebody stopped ON A PERSON is never filtered: that one is the person's
     * to clear, and the seat's job is to say so.
