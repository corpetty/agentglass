// --- keeping the sweep off the loop the PTY rides ----------------------------
//
// The scanner runs on the one thread that also pumps the terminal's PTY, so any
// stretch it spends parsing a transcript and inserting its events is a stretch
// the console is frozen. That cost is per line — a JSON.parse, then an
// insertEvent with its FTS write and its pre→post pairing query — so a cold
// backfill of a real machine's ~700MB of transcripts is minutes of it: measured
// at ~2s of dead loop PER 50MB file with the whole file in one transaction.
//
// So the per-file loop below runs in bounded BATCHES, each its own transaction,
// and yields the thread between them: the loop breathes, serves the PTY, and
// comes back for the next batch. Progress commits WITH each batch — lines_done
// advances atomically with that batch's inserts — so a crash or a failing later
// batch resumes exactly where it left off, never re-ingesting a committed batch
// (no double counts) and never dropping an uncommitted one. This replaces the
// old all-or-nothing single transaction, whose atomicity we reproduce across the
// batch boundary by only ever ADVANCING lines_done past what committed.
//
// Bounded by BOTH a line count and a byte budget: 500 ordinary lines measured at
// ~40ms of parse+insert on a real machine, comfortably under both the 80ms the
// PTY echo aims for and the 120ms at which the terminal starts to feel laggy;
// the byte budget makes a batch that lands on a cluster of multi-MB image lines
// yield just as promptly instead of parsing megabytes in one shot.
//
// Read per sweep, not pinned at import, for the same reason projectsDirs() is:
// `bun test` runs every file in one process, so a module-level constant would be
// fixed by whichever test imported this module first, defeating any test that
// overrides them. It is a handful of env reads per file — nothing measurable.
