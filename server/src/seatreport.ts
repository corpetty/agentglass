/*
 * THE INBOX — reports from the agents doing the work, in the shape the brief
 * asks for.
 *
 * The orchestrator this was modelled on had one thing at the top of its list:
 * a tray where each agent's report arrives in the fixed format without it
 * having to paste them five times. Today a worker messages the seat and the
 * report lands as prose in the most expensive context on the machine, which is
 * exactly the cost that made it demand a fixed shape in the first place — its
 * first round of statuses came back forty lines per agent.
 *
 * So a report is a ROW with four fields, and the seat drains them in one call.
 *
 * PARSED, NOT DEMANDED. An agent that writes the four labels gets four fields;
 * one that writes a paragraph gets that paragraph as its state and nothing is
 * lost. A parser that refuses a report is a parser that turns a status into an
 * argument about formatting, and the report is the thing that matters.
