// root; and the whole feature can be killed with AGENTGLASS_COMMIT_DISABLED=1.

 * instead of `a/file` and `b/file`. Our diff parser stripped `a/`/`b/` only, so
 * every path came out as `w/web/src/…`. The panel then asked for a diff of a
 * file by that name and got nothing, and staging one ran
 * `git add -- w/web/src/…`, which fails with "did not match any files". A
 * working repo looked like a broken app, and only for people with that setting.
 *
 * `diff.noprefix` is the same trap from the other side (no prefix at all),
 * `core.quotepath` escapes non-ASCII names into `\303\251` octal, and
 * `color.ui=always` would wrap everything we read in ANSI escapes.
 *
