/*
 * THE ORCHESTRATOR'S SEAT — somebody sitting in front of the board.
 *
 * The app already had eyes and hands and nobody in the chair. The Lantern
 * reads the field and answers when asked, and says so in its own rules:
 * "starts, stops, queues nothing". Named agents will start, prompt and stop
 * anything by name, but only when a script asks them to. What was missing is
 * the post itself — an agent whose whole job is to know who is working on
 * what, who is stopped and why, and to answer for them.
 *
 * Three decisions worth keeping:
 *
 * ONE PER PROJECT, KEYED BY ROOT. The rules an orchestrator runs by are the
 * project's, not the machine's: what may leave the machine, who merges, which
 * tracker exists. So the seat is a row per checkout root (`seat` in db.ts) and
 * its rules are a file per checkout root (seatdoctrine.ts), and a seat may be
 * opened at the root of any project this app knows — not only the open one,
 * which is a deliberate widening of what a write may touch and is why
 * `seatable()` below checks the project list rather than `inScope`.
 *
 * THE PROMPT IS COMPOSED HERE. The mark, the doctrine, the field and the
 * house block are put together by the server and handed to the CLI as one
 * argv element. Nothing about what the seat is told travels from a browser,
 * which is the same property `/lantern/ticket` keeps, and it is also what
 * makes the role honest: only a session the server seated can carry the mark.
 *
 * POWERS ARE A SETTING, NOT A SENTENCE. A doctrine that says "do not start
 * agents" is a wish. What the seat may do is decided by `powers` on its row
 * and enforced where the verb is served — the same lesson `refusedArg` in
 * agentops.ts learned about permission flags arriving as parameters.

 * say nothing: an empty box is more honest than a box full of furniture, and
 * the view does not draw one.
