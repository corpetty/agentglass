/*
 * How long a file is.
 *
 * The editor pane draws a strip of the whole file with a band per change, and
 * for that it needs one number. Reading the file to count its newlines is
 * cheaper than everything else on that screen and far cheaper than sending the
 * text back to throw it away — which is what asking `/files/read` for it would
 * be.
 *
 * The path may be absolute and outside the workspace, and that is deliberate:
 * a pull request's file is fetched to a temp copy precisely because it is not
 * in the checkout. It is held to the same rule the viewer is — in scope, or a
 * copy this server itself wrote — and nothing else is measurable.
