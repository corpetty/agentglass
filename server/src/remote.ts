// Everything the "open this on your phone" panel needs to tell the truth.
//
// Reaching the dashboard from another device is already possible — bind off
// loopback, set AGENTGLASS_TRUST_LAN=1, carry a token — but every part of that
// is invisible from inside the app, and one part of it is invisible from
// inside the *machine*: a host firewall. On a box with ufw's default deny the
// server binds 0.0.0.0 happily, prints its reassuring warning, answers every
// local check (loopback traffic never leaves `lo`, which ufw allows), and the
// phone still sees nothing at all. ufw DROPs rather than REJECTs, so the
// browser does not even get a refusal to render: it sits on a blank white page
// until it times out. There is no way to conclude anything from that except
// "this feature is broken".
//
// So this module answers three questions the UI could not ask before:
//   * where am I reachable — the actual LAN/tailnet URLs, not localhost;
//   * has any device actually arrived — proof, rather than a hopeful yes;
//   * if not, what is most likely eating it — the firewall on this machine,
//     named, with the exact command to open the port for the local subnet only.
//
// It never runs that command. Handing a GUI a root shell to fix a network
// problem is a worse trade than reading one line and pasting it.

// the uid the kernel records against its own socket. That is the whole basis of

 *    NOT loopback. A table that was just re-read and still has no row for a

 *  - No /proc at all -> loopback without a header: there is nothing to read.
 *  - No header and tailscaled runs as this process's own uid -> loopback.

 * Other raw forwarders (socat, `ssh -R`, `ngrok tcp`) run as the user and are
 * indistinguishable from his own processes by uid; this check does not cover
 * them, and binding to loopback is what keeps them the user's own choice.
 *
 * Where /proc does not exist (macOS, Windows) the owner cannot be read, so a
 * raw TCP forward is not caught there and a request with a header is
 * believed on the header alone. That is safe *for
 * authorization* and not for bookkeeping, and the difference matters: a forged
 * `X-Forwarded-For` can only ever move a caller from loopback to remote, which

 * `names` is every hostname this box answers to on its tailnet (its MagicDNS
 * name). `https` is set only when `tailscale serve` is actually terminating TLS
 * and proxying to our port — i.e. when a phone opening the https name would
 * reach us — so the pane never offers a secure address that 404s.
 *
 * Refreshed on a timer rather than per request: the gate reads `names`
 * synchronously on the hot path, and shelling out to `tailscale` there would
 * add a process spawn to every request.
 *
 * ── why this is not just a value ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * It is a TRUST cache. `trustedName` in index.ts reads it to decide whether a
 * WebSocket upgrade is allowed, and the phone deliberately presents its
 * MagicDNS origin (mobile/src/lib/live.ts says why at length). So an empty
 * `names` does not merely hide a row in a picker — it refuses `/stream`, and
 * the phone stops receiving alert frames while REST keeps answering on its 20s
 * poll. The app looks alive and has quietly stopped buzzing.
 *
 * The bug this shape fixes: every failure of `tailscale status` used to be
 * indistinguishable from "this machine has no tailnet name", and the empty set
 * was assigned unconditionally. One blip — tailscaled restarting, the socket
 * slow, the binary busy — landing on the 120s tick emptied it, and it healed
 * only on the next successful tick, up to two minutes later, with nothing said
 * anywhere. So: a probe that could not ASK never overwrites the last answer,
 * and it is retried sooner than a probe that could.

 *
 *   - The name only leaves `names` for real when `tailscale status` ANSWERS and

 *     is routing over the tailnet to us anyway; the only caller that can still
 *     present the name is one that already reaches the port some other way —
 *     loopback, or the LAN with AGENTGLASS_TRUST_LAN already on, both of which

 *   - And an accepted origin is not access. The token gate (auth.ts) and

 *     layer, not the credential.
