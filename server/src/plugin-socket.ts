/*
 * Slice 3: the one extra listener a boxed `network: "agentglass"` plugin
 * talks through instead of the internet — a unix socket, opened lazily the
 * first time such a plugin actually boxes, and stopped from
 * `stopAllPluginsSync` in plugins.ts.
 *
 * Kept free of any import from index.ts or plugins.ts on purpose: plugins.ts
 * already imports this module (to start and stop the listener), and index.ts
 * imports plugins.ts, so this module importing either one back would make a
 * cycle the bundler has broken on before (see CLAUDE.md, "Editing"). Instead
 * index.ts hands over its own request handler once, at boot, through
 * `setPluginSocketHandler` — the same shape `fetch` in `Bun.serve` always
 * had, just injected rather than imported.
 *
 * The handler itself never learns it is being called from here: every
 * request this module lets through arrives already scrubbed to look exactly
 * like a request from somewhere off this machine (see `fakeServer` below),
 * so the ordinary gate in index.ts — no tokenless sink, no isSelf, no
 * device-panel privilege — applies to a boxed plugin exactly as it would to
 * a stranger on the tailnet. The plugin-token check below is a SECOND,
 * narrower gate in front of that: only a plugin's own credential may use
 * this socket at all, checked here rather than left to the general gate,
 * because the general gate's job is "who is this", not "is this socket for
 * you" — a device or a machine token is a real credential, just never one
 * this socket exists for.
