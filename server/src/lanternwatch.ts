/*
 * THE LANTERN'S WATCH — the field re-read on a clock, and a loud word when
 * something on it needs a person.
 *
 * The Lantern's chat answers when asked, and the rail lights the moment
 * somebody is stopped on you; neither says anything to a person who is not
 * looking. "Have it look every fifteen minutes, go over everything again, and
 * if it finds something unattended or that we have forgotten, send us a
 * notification that is hard to miss." So: every N minutes the same board the
 * view reads is read here, and what it finds goes out through the alert
 * channel everything else in this app uses — the app's bell and the phone
 * when one is attached, the desktop's notifications otherwise, critical, so it
 * stays on screen until dismissed.
 *
 * On the server rather than in the chat's prompt, and that was the choice to
 * make: a watch inside a Claude session dies with its tab and spends a turn
 * every tick to reread a list; this one is on whenever the app is, reads the
 * facts directly, and costs nothing. The chat is told the watch exists so it
 * does not try to be one.
 *
 * What it flags is FACTS, in three kinds, and nothing it has to guess at:
 *   still waiting  — an agent stopped on a person: a permission, a held gate,
 *                    a turn waiting for its next prompt. The instant alert
 *                    already fired when it happened; this is the "still" —
 *                    fifteen minutes later it is still sitting there.
 *   forgotten      — an agent that said what it was working on, never said it
 *                    was done, and has been quiet for a long while: finished
 *                    and nobody looked, or stuck and nobody noticed.
 *   gone           — a named agent (a script's worker) whose window vanished
 *                    since the last look, without ever saying done.
 *
 * One notification per tick, never one per finding: the interval is the
 * throttle, and a person away from the machine gets one loud line every N
 * minutes while something needs them — which is what was asked for — rather
 * than a pile.
