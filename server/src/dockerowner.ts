/*
 * Which checkout a container came out of.
 *
 * Container names are global. Volumes are global. Ports are global. The only
 * thing on a container that remembers where it came from is compose's
 * `working_dir` label — and the panel already reads it, to decide what to show.
 * This turns the same label into the answer to the question people actually
 * ask in front of the screen: "is that mine, or is it the other worktree's?".
 *
 * Two rules shape everything here:
 *
 *   1. No processes. Resolving an owner must cost nothing, because it happens
 *      for every container on every poll. The path match is string work, and
 *      the branch is read straight out of `.git/HEAD` — a file read, not a
 *      `git` spawn, which is the difference between free and 30ms × N.
 *   2. Unknown stays unknown. A container from a directory this machine's open
 *      project knows nothing about gets its directory name and no branch, never
 *      a guess.
