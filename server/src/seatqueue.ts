/*
 * THE SEAT'S QUEUE — the work a project's orchestrator has been asked to see
 * done, and who is carrying each piece.
 *
 * Small on purpose. This is NOT a second work loop: the clone already has one
 * (understudy-work.ts) with sources, scoring and worktrees, and two things
 * that decide what to work on is how a run gets lost. This is a list a person
 * writes and a seat hands out — the seat picks who, opens the agent, and the
 * queue records that it did.
 *
 * THE CLAIM IS STAMPED WHEN THE WORK STARTS, never when it finishes. The
 * clone's queue was written the other way round once and the bug was not
 * theoretical: a run that failed left its row looking untouched, so the next
 * round picked the same item straight back up — against the checkout the
 * failure had deliberately left behind, which the loop then refused. Marking
 * at the start costs one honest state ("taken, and nothing came back") and
 * saves that whole class.
 *
 * PAST A CEILING IT STOPS BEING OFFERED. Two goes; after that the item is
 * still on the list but `next()` will not hand it out, because an item that
 * has beaten two agents is an item that needs a person to read it, and a queue
 * that keeps feeding it burns a turn every time the seat wakes.
