// served by the same loop that runs `git status`, parses `docker ps` and writes
// to SQLite. Anything that occupies that loop for 300ms is 300ms of a terminal
// that has stopped responding — and from the user's side it does not look like
// a slow endpoint, it looks like the app is broken.
//
// Finding those took a whole afternoon of bisecting with an external prober:
// ping a route that does no work, watch when the ping takes a second, guess
// what ran. This does it from the inside and keeps doing it, so the next one
// announces itself with the name of whatever was running.
//
// Deliberately in-memory and bounded, like the git command log: this is a live
// view of the current session, not an audit trail, and the value is entirely in
// the last few minutes.

 * a store on the root context — the label came back undefined in exactly the
 * case this exists for, which is not something to build an instrument on.
 *
 * So: capture and restore, explicitly. A caller reads the label synchronously
