/**
 * What a picture off the wire is allowed to be, decided from the bytes and
 * nothing the client said about them.
 *
 * `/terminal/image` used to trust the client's own filename for the
 * extension it wrote to disk — `name: "x.png"` bought a `.png` regardless of
 * what was inside, and the fallback for a name it did not recognise was
 * `.png` as well. A file that claims to be a picture and is not one is not a
 * client bug worth tolerating: the bytes go into a directory the terminal's
 * pane treats as safe to open, so the classification has to come from the
 * bytes, not the label glued to them.
 *
 * A strict base64 check comes first because `Buffer.from(str, "base64")`
 * never throws — it drops whatever it cannot decode and returns what is
 * left, so garbage input silently becomes a short, valid-looking buffer
 * instead of an error.
