 * Every branch this repository can be searched at, local and remote.

 * asked of a branch sitting in this repository that this worktree is not on,
 * and the only ways to look were to check it out — moving you off your work —
 * or to cut yet another worktree for a listing.
 *
 * Nothing here checks anything out. These names are handed to `ls-tree` and
 * `git grep <ref>`, which read the object store; the working tree is not
 * touched and HEAD does not move. That is the whole reason this can offer a
 * branch list at all without being dangerous.
