 *
 * A personal token rather than OAuth. OAuth would mean registering an
 * application, a client secret and a redirect the app has to catch, which is a
 * great deal of machinery for a local tool used by the person who owns the
 * token. Personal tokens do not expire, and the exchange is one header.
 *
 * That header is `Authorization: <token>` with NO `Bearer` prefix, which is
 * unusual enough to be worth stating: ClickUp's personal tokens are sent bare,
 * and adding `Bearer` produces a 401 that looks exactly like a wrong token.
