 * absent: the UI reads that as "we don't know" and keeps the delete
 * confirmation, which is the safe direction to be wrong in. So the list goes
 * out immediately and the sweep fills the very Set the cache entry holds, in
 * place, and records each verdict in probeMemo, which is what carries it past
 * the moment that Set is thrown away and rebuilt.
 *
 * Filling the Set is not enough on its own, and that was the bug: the answer
 * this endpoint serves is a JSON string cached against a fingerprint of every
 * ref, so it is only rebuilt when a ref MOVES. A sweep moves no refs. On a
 * repository nobody is committing to, which is exactly the repository you sit
 * down to tidy, the pre-sweep answer was served forever, and a branch whose PR
 * was squash-merged read "not merged, kept" until something unrelated happened
 * to move a ref. Measured on this repo: a branch merged 17 hours earlier, still
 * reported unmerged, two forced fingerprint changes needed to see the truth.
 *
 * So a sweep that changes a verdict says so. The hook clears that cached body
 * and nudges the clients, which is the one thing the sweep could not do for
 * itself. Fired once, when the sweep finishes, and only when it actually proved
 * something: a sweep that learns nothing must not cost a rebuild.
 *
 * Newest first: that's the order for-each-ref gives with this sort, and the

 *
 * A base is a branch whose TIP is an ancestor of this branch (it was built on
 * top of it) but which is NOT already in the trunk — a feature branch this one
 * is stacked on. `git` does that filter in a single pass (`--merged <branch>
 * --no-merged <trunk>`), so a repo with hundreds of refs still returns only the
 * handful in the stacking chain. The closest of them — fewest commits between
 * its tip and the branch — is the direct base.
 *
 * **Only published branches are candidates**, when the repo has an `origin` at
 * all. `--merged <branch>` matches *any* ref that happens to be an ancestor,
 * and a working repository is full of refs that are ancestors by accident: the
 * `pr1042-review`, `pr1039`, `pr998-review` someone left behind after
 * reading a diff. Those sit a commit or two back, so they win the
 * fewest-commits test outright and become the "base" — a scratch ref this
 * branch was never cut from. Having a counterpart on the remote is what tells a
 * branch somebody is stacked on from a bookmark somebody made. Repos with no
 * remote keep the unfiltered set, because there the distinction does not exist.
 *
 * What comes back is a *name*, not the ref to measure. `--merged` can only ever
 * match a copy of the base this branch is already level with, so measuring the
 * ref it returns is guaranteed to report zero — see `freshest`, which `baseOf`
 * applies to the answer.
 *
 * Relative to `branch`, never to `HEAD`: `worktrees()` resolves every sibling's
 * base from the family's MAIN checkout, so `HEAD` there is the main branch, not
 * the sibling being asked about — reading `--merged HEAD` made every worktree
 * infer the main branch's base and fall through to the trunk. `<branch>` names
 * the tip we actually mean regardless of which checkout runs the query.
 *
 * Returns null when there is nothing between the branch and the trunk, so
 * `baseOf` falls back to the trunk. A branch's own upstream (`origin/<self>`)

 *   * `<repo>/.worktrees/<name>` — the nested layout, kept because it was the
 *     documented one. It has a cost the sibling layout doesn't: the directory
 *     is untracked, so the repo reports itself dirty forever after.
 *

 *      files back; the deletion still happens as the user afterwards, subject
 *      to every check that already exists. The worst outcome of a bug here is
 *      that a directory the user owns becomes a directory the user owns.
 *   3. The path is not taken from the caller. It has to match a worktree this
 *      repository currently reports, so a crafted request cannot point root at
 *      an arbitrary directory. Arguments go as an array — there is no shell to
