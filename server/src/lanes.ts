/**
 * Lanes: private browser windows an agent drives without the person's window.
 *
 * A lane is a hidden host window (electron/main.js, createLaneHost) with one
 * webview in it. This module is the table of them and the rules about them; it
 * has no idea how a window is made or asked. browserdrive.ts hands it the two
 * things it needs (`configureLanes`), so the import only goes one way.
 *
 * Rules, each one measured or forced by something that went wrong elsewhere:
 *
 *   - A cap on how many, because every lane is a renderer plus a guest and the
 *     cost is memory the person did not agree to spend.
 *   - An idle TTL. Nobody closes a lane an agent forgot, and a hidden window
 *     cannot be seen to be forgotten.
 *   - An ask naming a lane that is not in the table is a named refusal and
 *     never falls through to the visible tab (browserdrive.ts, askOnce): an
 *     agent that lost its lane must not start clicking in the person's window.

   *  the person's own container, on purpose. `named` is one of the containers
   *  `profiles` lists, by `name`. `ephemeral` (S6, `lane new --from-template`)
