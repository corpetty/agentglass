 * THE LANTERN'S BOARD, assembled from every part of the machine at once.

 * `agentboard.ts` is the JOIN and stays pure — its readers are injected so a
 * test can pin who wins when sources disagree. This is the module that goes
 * and gets them: the tmux socket for the panes, git for the worktrees and
 * whether a branch is in, the deputy's own run table, the hooks' sightings,
 * the session names, and who is stopped on a person. One function, because
 * two surfaces need the same answer — the `/agents/board` route the view and
 * the rail read, and the terminal's "Ask about the field", which opens a chat
 * on the engine with this same board as its first message. Two copies of the
 * assembly would be two boards that could disagree.
