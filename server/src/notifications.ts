/**
 * Desktop notifications, mirrored onto the workspace notch.
 *
 * Why this exists: agentglass is a fullscreen daily driver. A Slack ping fires
 * a system notification you never see, because the thing covering your screen
 * is this app. The notch is the one strip that is always visible, so it is
 * where that ping should land.
 *
 * How: every desktop notification on Linux is a D-Bus method call. Apps call
 * `Notify` on org.freedesktop.Notifications (Slack, being Electron, does
 * exactly this) and GTK apps call `AddNotification` on org.gtk.Notifications.
 * We ask the session bus to make us a *monitor* for those two calls and read
 * them as they fly past. We never become the notification daemon and never
 * answer a call, so the user's normal pop-ups keep working exactly as they did
 * — this is a copy, not an interception.
 *
 * Nothing here runs unless a client is subscribed, and the UI only subscribes
 * when the user has turned the feature on. Nothing is ever written to disk.
