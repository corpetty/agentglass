/**
 * Every Claude Code session belonging to a project, whichever checkout it ran in.
 *
 * What this exists for: resuming one is three steps by hand — open a tab, start
 * the agent, type `/resume`, find the session in a list — and the list `/resume`
 * shows is scoped to the directory the agent happens to be running in. A card
 * worked on in a worktree is invisible from the main checkout, so the sessions
 * you most want back are the ones the built-in list cannot offer.
 *
 * Read from disk rather than from this app's database, and that is deliberate:
 * `/resume` reads `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<id>.jsonl`, so reading the same
 * files is the only way to be sure the two lists agree. A session the scanner
 * never ingested — a machine where agentglass was installed last week, a
 * transcript older than the retention window — is still there on disk and is
 * still resumable, and a picker that quietly omitted it would be worse than no
 * picker at all.
 *
 * The cost is bounded on purpose: the slug is a pure function of the path, so a
 * project's transcripts are found by NAMING the directories rather than by
 * walking every project on the machine, and only the head of each transcript is
 * read (the title is in the first user message, and the files run to hundreds of
 * megabytes).
