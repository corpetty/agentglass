# Security Policy

agentglass is a **local-first developer tool**: the server is designed to run on
`localhost`, and it can stage/commit/push git, merge pull requests, control
Docker, open real shells, start `claude` sessions and open files in your editor
on the machine it runs on. Treat the server port like you would treat `sshd` on
your workstation — do not expose it to the public internet.

A LAN is **not** trusted by default. Reaching the server from another machine is
a deliberate three-part act: bind off loopback, set `AGENTGLASS_TRUST_LAN=1`, and
carry a token. See [Trust model](#trust-model) below.

The desktop app performs all three as one switch (Settings › Remote), which
mints the token itself. It is off by default, it states in plain words what
turning it on grants, and turning it off closes the port rather than merely
hiding the link.

Adding a device is a separate, deliberate act — see
[Pairing a device](#pairing-a-device). The QR code is an *invitation*, not a
credential: a photograph of the screen does not pair anything.

## Supported versions

Only the latest `main` is supported. There are no LTS branches; fixes land on
`main` and ship immediately. Installed desktop builds track **release tags**
rather than the branch tip, so a fix reaches them when it is tagged — the in-app
updater (POSIX only) offers the newest tag, and Windows installs update by
downloading the installer again.

## Automated scanning

The repository is watched by **CodeQL** (code scanning) and **Dependabot**
(GitHub Actions updates), and a secret scanner runs over every push. These
complement, rather than replace, the private reporting path below.

## Trust model

- **Origin and Host gates.** Every route is behind a same-origin/private-host
  check, plus a DNS-rebinding guard that refuses a request arriving under a
  `Host` that is not localhost or private (`AGENTGLASS_ALLOWED_HOSTS` allows a
  reverse-proxy name explicitly).
- **Token.** `AGENTGLASS_TOKEN` is required on every route except `/health`, the
  pairing handshake, and the local senders' own routes — the telemetry intake
  sinks (`/ingest`, the OTLP receivers) and `/agents/status`, a hooked session
  saying what it is working on — **when the request arrives on loopback**.
  Local hooks and OTel exporters have no way to carry a secret, so the exemption exists for them; it
  is a property of where the request came from and not of the path alone,
  because those sinks write permanent rows and the alert they raise leaves the
  machine, from a process of the same user (checked via `/proc` on Linux —
  elsewhere loopback alone decides, the same as before). Same-user processes
  can already read the 0600 token file, so the exemption serves only the
  server's own uid; another account, or a host-networked container under a
  different uid, dialing loopback needs the token — where one is configured
  at all: a tokenless server (no `AGENTGLASS_TOKEN`, loopback-only bind) has
  nothing for this check to gate and stays open to any uid, same as before —
  it now warns loudly at startup that this is the case, but does not
  refuse to run. From anywhere else —
  including through a reverse proxy — they need the token like everything
  else. `/health` stays open to anyone: it stores
  nothing, and the pairing screen probes it before it has a credential to carry.
  Binding off loopback — **or setting `AGENTGLASS_TRUST_LAN=1` at all** — makes a
  token mandatory; if none is set the server mints, persists (`0600`) and prints
  one.
- **A proxy cannot claim to be loopback.** `tailscale serve` terminates TLS and
  re-dials the port from `127.0.0.1`, which would otherwise hand the whole
  tailnet the loopback exemption above. Forwarding headers are never the
  decision on their own: `X-Forwarded-For` is consulted only when the socket peer
  is loopback *and* the uid owning that socket is tailscaled's, and a proxied
  request is treated as remote unconditionally. The socket owner is checked for
  every loopback connection, header or not, so a raw TCP forward
  (`tailscale serve --tcp`) that adds no header is remote too. Not covered: a
  forwarder running as your own user (`socat`, `ssh -R`, `ngrok tcp`), which is
  indistinguishable from your own processes, and systems without `/proc`.
- **Intake is rate-limited** rather than authenticated: `AGENTGLASS_RATE_MAX`
  requests per source-address+route inside `AGENTGLASS_RATE_WINDOW_MS`.
- **Hooks refuse to send anywhere but this machine.** The hook and seed scripts
  post full session transcripts, and their destination — `AGENTGLASS_SERVER` —
  is attacker-influenceable: a repo-local `settings.json` can set it, so cloning
  a repository could otherwise redirect your prompts and file contents to
  somebody else's host. Anything that is not `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` / `::1`
  is refused with a message on stderr, and the script exits 0 so a hostile
  setting cannot break the agent either. `AGENTGLASS_ALLOW_REMOTE=1` is the
  explicit opt-out, for the case where the server genuinely runs elsewhere.
- **Desktop-only routes.** The self-update route executes arbitrary code and is
  reachable from the packaged shell's own origin and nothing else — not from a
  browser, not from another machine.
  It builds only an annotated release tag, pinned to the commit the tag names,
  installs from the lockfile, and writes its log under the user's cache
  rather than `/tmp`. The tag's signature MUST verify against one pinned SSH
  key (`electron/release-allowed-signers`, committed) — checked against that
  file alone, never the local machine's own gpg/ssh trust store, so a stray
  key already configured there cannot pass. An unsigned tag, or one signed by
  any other key, is refused before anything is built.
- **The token is never served over any route, to anyone.** `/remote/status`
  reports where the server is reachable and whether a device has arrived, and
  the addresses it returns are addresses — nothing in that answer, or in any
  other, is a credential. It used to hand the token back to a caller on this
  machine, because the QR code *was* the token and the pane had to draw it;
  pairing replaced that, and a URL that grants a shell is exactly what ends up
  in a screenshot of the pane it is drawn in.
- **A device holds its own credential, at its own level.** See
  [Pairing a device](#pairing-a-device).
- **Tailnet addresses.** CGNAT (`100.64.0.0/10`, what Tailscale assigns) counts
  as private under `AGENTGLASS_TRUST_LAN=1`, alongside RFC1918. It is reachable
  only across an authenticated, encrypted mesh, so it is a narrower grant than
  trusting a wifi network, and it rides the same opt-in.
- **Root escalation, once, with a visible prompt.** Rescuing a worktree whose
  files another user owns shells out to `pkexec chown`, so the desktop's own
  password dialog is what authorises it. The path is validated first, precisely
  so a crafted root cannot point a privileged `chown -R` somewhere else.
- **The control plane is fail-open by default.** A `PreToolUse` gate that times
  out (`AGENTGLASS_GATE_TIMEOUT`, 300s) falls through rather than blocking your
  agents. Set `AGENTGLASS_GATE_FAILCLOSED=1` if you would rather a timeout or an
  unreachable control plane denied the call.
- **Who receives a browser ask is the app's to say.** Registering a window that
  can drive the built-in browser (`/browser/ready`), or the app window that makes
  lane hosts, decides who is sent every ask, fill text and URLs included, so it
  is held to the same key as releasing a hold. The same ceiling applies. Where
  the app **adopts** a server that is already running (a sidecar left from an
  earlier launch, one started by hand), no pipe from this launch handed that
  server a key, so the app claims its desk: it proves the server holds the token, names a fresh key
  on `/desk/claim` and keeps that request open, and while it does the key is
  what both gates ask for. Only the machine token itself may claim, with no
  `Origin`, from a direct loopback socket — callers that could forge the app's
  `Origin` anyway — so a claim made by something other than the app gains it
  nothing it could not already reach by forging that `Origin`. The limit is first
  come, first served: a token holder that claims before the app does, or in the
  moment after the app's claim drops, holds the desk until it lets go, and the
  app's own window is refused the browser role and a hold's release there (a
  paired phone still answers). The app does not start a second server on the
  same database to get around it; it says so in its log and in a banner in the
  window, which claims again on Retry once the other process has let go, or
  that server is restarted. A sidecar that outlived an earlier launch was piped
  that launch's key and refuses a claim the same way. With no app attached, a server started by hand is on the
  `Origin` rule. An agent's lane is likewise only as private as
  `as` is honest: an identity is a claim, not a credential.
- **The desktop app adopts only a server that proves it holds the token.** A
  server already on its port must answer a fresh random challenge on `/health`
  with an HMAC made with the token and bound to that port; until it does, the
  app sends it nothing secret, and a server that cannot prove it (another
  account's process, a container on the host network, a build from before the
  check, a server started by hand without a token) is left alone while the app
  starts its own on the next free port. If the app's own server then fails to
  come up — something won the bind first, or every candidate port is taken —
  the windows drop the token before they make a request. A development shell
  (`make desktop-dev`) still adopts the tokenless `make dev` server on the
  marker alone.
  The proof is a point in time: if the proven server exits and another
  process on this machine binds the same port before the app notices, the
  app's next request — the desk claim included — carries the token to it.
  Winning that race needs a local process watching the port.
- **A held call is not released by the process being held.** Answering one
  (`/gate/decide`) needs a paired device with the `answer` grant, or — where the
  desktop app started the server — the app's own key, which it mints at launch
  and hands only to its sidecar, down a pipe, and to its own renderer. There an
  `Origin` opens nothing, and the same holds on a server the app adopted while
  the app holds its claim (above). On a server started by hand, where no desk
  holds a key, an `Origin` this server already trusts still does: a browser attaches one
  to every POST it makes. The machine token on its own is not an answer, because
  the agent whose call is held holds that token too. *Raising* a hold
  (`POST /gate`) is untouched: that one is the hook asking to be stopped. What
  this is and is not worth is in
  [What the gate does not protect against](#what-the-gate-does-not-protect-against).

## Pairing a device

Handing a phone the machine's token had three consequences, and all three are
why this is now a handshake:

* **anyone who could see the screen was paired.** The QR carried the credential,
  so a photograph, a screenshot in a chat or a shared window in a call was a
  working key;
* **a lost phone could not be cut off.** One token meant revoking was rotating,
  and rotating kicked every device including the desk;
* **everything could do everything.** A phone that only ever approves gates had
  a terminal, git write access and Docker control.

The handshake, in `server/src/pairing.ts`:

1. **The machine mints an invitation.** A ticket id goes in the QR; a six-digit
   code is shown on the screen and nowhere else. Both last two minutes.
2. **The phone proves it can see that screen.** It scans the QR, generates a
   P-256 keypair that never leaves the browser, and types the code. Five wrong
   guesses from one address shuts that address out, even for the right code; ten
   from all addresses together closes the invitation outright. Knowing the
   invitation's id, which is in the QR, is not enough to close it from one
   address; a guesser with several addresses can still spend the shared ten.
3. **A person at the machine agrees.** The request appears in the Remote pane
   naming the device, the address it came from and the same six digits, and
   waits. Nothing is minted until somebody accepts, and accepting is where the
   device's level is chosen.
4. **The credential is delivered to that claimant and nobody else.** It is
   encrypted to the key from step 2 (ECDH → HKDF → AES-256-GCM, salted with the
   ticket) and collected exactly once, authorised by a secret only the claimant
   holds.

What this gives you, and what it does not:

- **The QR is not a credential.** Photographing it, or scanning it from a shared
  screen, gets a form asking for six digits that are not in the picture.
- **The credential never travels in the clear.** The server speaks plain HTTP
  over the LAN, so anything on that network sees the whole exchange — ticket,
  code, both public keys — and still has no key.
- **It does not defend against an active on-path attacker today.** The phone's
  public key is not bound to the six-digit code shown only at the machine, so
  someone who can rewrite traffic can substitute their own key and the pairing
  completes anyway — that code is an out-of-band channel the handshake does
  not use yet; comparing a fingerprint of the key against it at accept time
  would detect the substitution. Until then, on a network you do not own, use
  the Tailscale address, which is encrypted end to end; the pane says so where
  the choice is made.
- **Credentials are stored hashed** (`~/.config/agentglass/devices.json`, `0600`)
  and compared in constant time. A readable file is not a working key.

**Levels.** A paired device is `read`, `answer` or `full`, chosen when the
request is accepted and defaulting to `answer`:

| Level | What it can do |
|---|---|
| `read` | Every GET but the desk's private ones (the terminal, browsing history, plugin settings, desktop notifications), plus the POSTs that only read. Approves nothing, sends nothing. |
| `answer` | The above, plus `/gate/decide` and replying to a session that is running now — an open chat pane, not any session id it can read. It cannot allow a tool call in a session it sent the turn to: another device or the desk has to. |
| `full` | Everything the machine can do: the terminal, git write, Docker, merging pull requests. |

Enforcement is **deny by default**: anything that changes state and is not named
as a read or an answer requires `full`, so a route added later is out of a
paired phone's reach until somebody decides otherwise. `/terminal/pty` is
explicitly `full` despite arriving as a `GET` — a browser cannot put a header on
a WebSocket upgrade, and a rule that trusted the method would hand a read-only
device an interactive shell.

Below `full`, two reads are narrowed further. The pull-request image proxy
lends your GitHub token only to an image URL that a pull request this server
has fetched actually carries; any other URL is fetched anonymously. And the
Docker reads that start a process per request are capped at four in flight per
credential.

**Revoking one device** (Settings › Remote › Paired devices › Forget) revokes
that credential and closes the sockets it is holding, and leaves every other
device — and the desk — alone. Rotating the machine's token is still there for
the case where you have lost the code itself, and still kicks everything.

## What the gate does not protect against

The `PreToolUse` gate stops an agent before a tool call and holds it until
somebody answers. That is a brake on a workflow: the destructive command gets
looked at before it runs, a phone gets somewhere to answer it from, and every
decision leaves a line in the activity log. It is **not** a boundary against
code running as you on this machine, and that is a limit worth stating here
rather than waiting for somebody else to state it.

Not because the routes are open — they are authenticated like the rest.
`/gate/decide` is in the scope list, so a paired phone needs `answer` or `full`
to reach it, and a caller from off this machine carrying no token is refused
before any route sees it. Three narrower things are true, and all three end in
the same place.

- **The read routes carry no cross-origin check.** `/gate/decide` is behind
  `trustedCaller`, which turns away a browser that is neither same-origin nor
  private, and behind the release rule below on top of that. `/gate/status`,
  `/gate/pending` and `/gate/history` sit behind the surface-wide origin gate
  only, and that one waves an Origin-less caller through on purpose, because
  the hooks and the OTLP exporters cannot send one. Reading the queue is not
  answering it — but the queue holds the command an agent is about to run.
- **A server started by hand has no token to check.** `resolveToken` returns
  `{token: null}` when it is loopback-only and `AGENTGLASS_TOKEN` is unset
  (`server/src/auth.ts`), so the shared-secret gate is skipped rather than
  passed, and nothing downstream ever learns *who* is asking. Every rule graded
  by that — the `answer` grant, the deny-by-default table, and the device half
  of the release rule below — is not loosened on such a box, it is simply never
  consulted, and what is left of the release rule there is the `Origin` header
  alone. Remote callers are still refused outright; local ones were never being
  asked for anything.

  This is **not** how the desktop app runs. It mints a secret on first launch
  and hands it to its own sidecar (`electron/main.js`), so the app is
  authenticated on loopback too — which is what `docs/CONFIG.md` describes. The
  tokenless case is `bun run dev`, a hand-started server, and anything else that
  launches the sidecar itself. If that is you, set `AGENTGLASS_TOKEN`.
- **The token does not separate you from your own agents.** When one is set it
  is at `~/.config/agentglass/token`, `0600`, and the shipped hook reads it from
  exactly there — which is something anything running under your account can do.
  An agent that has swallowed a hostile instruction out of a README it cloned is
  running under your account. `0600` stops another user on the box; it does not
  stop a process that is already you. Answering a held call is the one thing
  that credential no longer opens on its own, which is the rest of this section.

### The one on that list that was a bug

Everything above is a limit of what a tool pointed at your own machine can
promise. One consequence of the last of them was not a limit but a defect, and
it is worth writing down rather than quietly fixing.

Until this change, the credential the shipped hook reads in order to **submit** a
gate also opened the route that **answers** one. `/gate/decide` was behind the
origin check the rest of the write surface uses, and that check waves an
Origin-less caller through on loopback on purpose — because that is exactly what
a hook is. An agent's own shell has the same shape. So the agent whose tool call
was being held could release it with one `curl` carrying a token it already had,
and two things followed. The decision was recorded as `local`, byte for byte
what a person pressing Approve in the desktop app writes, so the activity log
could not tell the two apart afterwards. And the stopped model was handed the
sentence written for a human answer — *"A human reviewed this call in agentglass
and approved it"* — so a call nobody had looked at came back to the agent as one
somebody had. The case that matters here is not the agent that sets out to work
around a hold. It is the helpful one, taking "approve the gate" as the next step
of the task it was given; and the one told to by a pull-request description,
which this app renders from whatever repository you happen to be triaging.

So `/gate/decide` now asks for something the held party has no way to produce: a
paired device with the `answer` grant, or one of the origins this server already
trusts — a foreign website is turned away by that check as it always was. `curl`,
`urllib` and the other libraries an agent reaches for send no such header, and
the machine token on its own is no longer an answer — so the sentence the
stopped model is handed, that a human reviewed this call, now costs one of those
two things. Raising a hold is unchanged: `POST /gate` is the hook asking to be
stopped, which was the half that worked.

That much made self-release deliberate rather than incidental, and no more: a
header is a string, and a local process that set `Origin: agentglass://app` on
purpose, with the token it already had, released its own call. Closing that
takes a credential the agent cannot read, one the desk holds and the token file
does not, and where the desktop app runs the server that is what now stands in
for the `Origin`. The app mints a key for each sidecar it starts and keeps it in
memory. It hands it to that sidecar down a pipe on a descriptor of its own — not
the environment and not the command line, which any process of this user reads
in `/proc` — and to its own window through the preload, and to nothing the agent
browser opens, nor to a server the app adopted instead of starting. The server
reads it before anything it starts could inherit the pipe, and from then on a
release carries that key or a paired device's credential, and an `Origin` counts
for nothing (`server/src/desk.ts`). Accepting a pairing asks for the same,
because a device accepted is a device that releases holds. That closes the
`Origin` forgery. The other way in was the device store, and the server now
holds that in memory (below).

What is left, at no more than its real value:

- **A server started by hand has no desk.** No key exists there, and the client
  a person uses there without pairing first is a browser, which cannot hold a
  secret an agent on the same machine could not also read. So the `Origin` rule
  stands on such a server, with its limit: the obvious `curl` is refused and a
  deliberate forgery passes. That is `bun run dev`, a sidecar you launch
  yourself, and a desktop window that adopted a server it did not start — and,
  for now, the desktop app on Windows, which does not hand its sidecar the pipe.
- **Memory is not a wall against yourself either.** A process that can read
  another's memory reads the key: `kernel.yama.ptrace_scope=0`, root, a core
  dump the system keeps where you can read it (systemd-coredump does), or the
  renderer's debugging port when you set `AGENTGLASS_DEBUG_PORT`. So does a
  script running in the app's own window, as it reads the token. A key is only
  good for the sidecar it was minted for, so one read out of a crashed sidecar
  opens nothing the next one holds.
- **The device store is read once.** `devices.json` is `0600` on this same
  machine, which is the same *already you* the bullet above ends on. The server
  used to read it on every request, so a process that wrote a device of its own
  into it held a credential that answered gates. Now the server loads it when it
  starts and changes it only through pairing: a row written behind its back is
  not a device, the change is said on stderr and as an urgent notification at
  the desk, and the next pairing write puts the server's own set back. A row
  planted and then followed by a restart is loaded — the file is the store.
- **Out of scope: a process that is you and sets out to.** One that can edit
  the store and restart the server, or replace the app's files or the server's
  binary, can make it trust anything. Nothing a server running as you checks
  holds against code running as you with that intent; what these rules remove
  is the accident, the helpful agent and the one an injected instruction sends.

The record can only say what the caller proved, and it is worth reading it that
way. A paired device signs its own line with the name that was accepted when it
was paired — and accepting is now itself behind the same rule, because it was
the sharper hole. A machine token alone could ask for a ticket, accept its own
ticket, and mint a device with any label; releasing a hold through that device
then needed no header at all, and the line read as a phone somebody had once
approved. An audit log that invents a named human is worse than one that only
fails to say which process it was, so `/pair/accept` asks for the same proof
`/gate/decide` does. What that does not reach, and nothing here can, is a row
appended to `devices.json` directly — same file, same 0600, same *already you*. Everything else is `local`, and
`local` means *this machine*: the desk, the dashboard it serves, and anything
here that got past the rule above by looking like one of them. Nothing about a
person pressing Approve moved — the same actor, the same words to the agent, on
the same routes — which is the regression that would have made this change worse
than the bug it fixed. But the log is not a second line of defence: it records
what was presented, which is the limit above seen from the other end.

So the honest scope: the gate is a **human-workflow brake, not a security
boundary against a process running as you**. It earns its place because the
thing on the other side of it is a model that would otherwise run the command
the moment it thought of it, and the pause is where a person gets to say no. The
change above makes that sentence more true rather than obsolete: a brake the
braked thing cannot release by accident is what a brake is, and something
deliberately working around this one still runs as you, reads the same files,
talks to the same port and can set the same header. Where a capability must not
be exercised at all, turn it off — the knobs below hold in a way the gate does
not.

## What agentglass stores, and how to get rid of it

Everything below is on your machine and nowhere else. There is no account, no
sync, and no upload — the hooks refuse to post anywhere but this host (see
`AGENTGLASS_ALLOW_REMOTE` above). But it is worth saying plainly what lands on
disk, because **nothing in the app deletes it** on its own: there is no route,
no button and no menu item that removes recorded history, and the only sweep is
the retention window below. Four routes remove a row *you* asked the app to
hold for you, and nothing else: `POST /understudy/work/unask` takes one task
back out of the Clone's queue; `POST /agents/status` with `done: true` drops a
session's own "what it is working on" line, and only when the same session that
wrote it asks; `POST /agents/forget` drops such a line by name whoever wrote it
— the Lantern's clear button, authenticated like every other route (so, on a
loopback-only install with no token, open to local callers like the rest), for
a session that ended without saying so; and `POST /bench/note` with empty text
deletes that checkout's bench note, a file of its own under the data directory.
None of the four touches an event, a session or a decision.

One route is named as if it did: `/browser/places/forget` throws away the
browsing history you imported from your own browser. That history is kept in
its own file rather than in the events database — `places.db` beside it —
exactly so that deleting it takes one call and costs you none of your fleet's
history. Nothing agentglass recorded is removed by it. The `Clear ✕` in the header clears
*filters*, not history.

One row in the database is not recorded data and is deleted routinely: the
**database claim** — the pid, port and hostname of the server process that owns
the file, written at boot and dropped on a clean exit. It exists so a second
server cannot run a second transcript scanner over the same history, which
double-counts events, tokens and cost in silence. It holds nothing about your
sessions.

| Where | What is in it |
|---|---|
| `~/.local/share/agentglass/agentglass.db`<br><sub>or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/agentglass/`; `$AGENTGLASS_STATE_DIR/agentglass.db` or `$AGENTGLASS_DB` when set. An `agentglass.db` in the working directory is never opened: it is copied here once if this one does not exist yet, and the original is left where it was — delete it yourself once the copy is checked</sub> | Every event, with its `summary`, its `error_text` and the **raw hook payload** — which for a tool call is the command line, the file path, and the prompt. Plus session totals, the full-text search index, gate decisions, the daily rollup, and the **activity log** — every write the dashboard performed, with the address it came from. |
| `~/.config/agentglass/token` | The shared secret, `0600`, when one has been minted. |
| `~/.config/agentglass/devices.json` | One row per paired device, `0600`: its name, its level, when it was added and last used, and a **SHA-256 of its credential** — never the credential. Revoked rows are kept rather than deleted, so "did I definitely cut that phone off" stays answerable. |
| `~/.config/agentglass/config.json` | The active project scope and the UI switches. |
| `~/.config/agentglass/clickup-views.json` | The ClickUp boards you saved, and a copy of the last thing each one returned — task titles, statuses and tags. Not a secret and not `0600`: it is a cache of things you can already see, kept on disk so the panel opens instantly instead of waiting a second and a half after every restart. Delete it and it rebuilds. |
| `~/.config/agentglass/credentials.json` | **API tokens for services you connected in Settings → Integrations**, `0600`, alongside what the service said about each one — the account name and workspace, so a card can say who you are without a round trip. Only providers with no CLI of their own land here: `gh` keeps GitHub's token in your system keyring and agentglass never reads it. |

### About that credentials file

It is `0600`, and `0600` is a real boundary: another user on this machine cannot
read it. It is **not encrypted**, and that is a limit worth stating rather than
papering over — any key this process could read unattended would have to sit
next to the thing it protects, which buys a feeling rather than a defence.

So the honest scope is: `0600` stops another account on this computer. It does
not stop a backup of your home directory, a synced dotfiles repository, or
anyone who can already read your files as you. If that matters for a given
token, prefer a provider with a CLI that uses the system keyring, and scope the
token narrowly wherever the service lets you.

The token is never sent to the browser. It goes in through one route, is
verified against the service before anything is written, and after that the app
answers with a status — who you are, which workspace, how many tasks — and never
with the credential. It is not written to logs either: where one has to be
named, only a prefix and a length are printed.

### One more outbound request: assignee pictures

The ClickUp panel draws the people on a card as their avatars, and those images
come from ClickUp's own attachment host — so opening a board makes a request per
distinct person, carrying no credential and no referrer. It is the same kind of
request the pull-request list already makes for GitHub avatars.

Nothing is uploaded and nothing about you is in the URL: it is a picture your
workspace already publishes to anyone who can see the card. If that request is
unwelcome, the panel is still correct without it — a person with no photo is
drawn as their initials on their own colour, which is what happens today for
anyone who never uploaded one.

**One feature sends your code off this machine.** The AI **Explain**
walkthrough hands your changed lines to a model — the local `claude` CLI, or the
Anthropic API if you have set a key — so it can describe them. That is what the
button is for, and it runs only when you press it. It has a switch of its own,
`AGENTGLASS_WALKTHROUGH_DISABLED=1`, and where it sends is checked before either
transport is chosen: a custom `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is refused unless
`AGENTGLASS_ALLOW_REMOTE=1` says otherwise, on the local CLI path as much as the
API one. Three more paths exist and all three are off until you turn them on:
`AGENTGLASS_WEBHOOK` (what travels through it is listed under
[What leaves through the webhook](#what-leaves-through-the-webhook)); the
Clone's judge, which hands `claude -p` the material it is comparing — through
the same local CLI, only after the private-terms gate, and only with the `judge`
setting on; and `AGENTGLASS_PRICING_REFRESH=1`, described next.

### One request that carries nothing: the price catalogue

With `AGENTGLASS_PRICING_REFRESH=1`, the server reads LiteLLM's published price
table from `raw.githubusercontent.com` once at boot and once a day. It is a
**GET of a public file** — no credential, no query string, no body, and nothing
about you, your models or your spend goes with it. What comes back is validated
before it can replace anything: over five megabytes is refused, a redirect is
refused rather than followed, a catalogue with fewer than a hundred usable
models is rejected whole, and the bundled table stays in place if any of that
fails. Where it may go is checked by the same `outboundDestination()` that
guards the webhook and `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, with GitHub's raw host trusted for
this one read the way the webhook trusts Slack's and Discord's.

The observable fact is that the machine makes a request at all, which on a
network you would rather stayed quiet is worth knowing: it is off by default,
and off means no request. `AGENTGLASS_PRICING` — your own price file — disables
the refresh outright and stays authoritative.

What it will not send: files whose contents are a credential by design (`.env*`,
`*.pem`, `*.key`, `id_rsa`, `credentials.json`, `.npmrc`, and their neighbours)
are held back, and the patches that do go are run through the same secret
scrubber the crash reporter uses, for a key pasted into an ordinary source file.
Anything withheld is **named on screen** rather than quietly missing — a summary
of a different changeset than the one you are looking at is worse than none.

Two things about retention are easy to get wrong:

- **`AGENTGLASS_RETENTION_DAYS` bounds the raw events, not the history.** Expiring
  events are folded into a daily rollup *before* they are deleted, so per-day
  totals — cost, tokens, error counts, session counts — survive the prune and
  keep accumulating. That is the point of the feature, and it means the default
  8 days is not how long agentglass remembers you.
- **The rollup has no expiry at all.** Nothing prunes it, and there is no path
  in the product that removes a row from it. It is designed to be kept for
  years.
- **The task list is read, not recorded.** Tasks live in your Taskwarrior store
  and agentglass keeps no copy, so deleting one there is not this promise's
  business — it is your list, and the app is a second window onto it. What
  agentglass stores about tasks is the reminders you set, above.
- **A reminder you have answered ages out; one you have not never does.** The
  reminders table is pruned on the same cutoff as the events, but only for rows
  that have been acknowledged or cancelled. A reminder still waiting for you is
  a live request, however old its row looks — the same ruling held tools get.
- **Neither does the activity log.** Settings › Activity is an audit trail, so
  it is append-only by design: every git write, container action, pull-request
  action and gate decision, with what it touched and the address it came from
  (`local` for this machine, otherwise the IP — there are no accounts here, so
  a name would be invented). One row per thing a person pressed, which is tens
  a day rather than the thousands an hour the events table takes.
- **The Clone's and the Lantern's tables have windows of their own**, and
  `AGENTGLASS_RETENTION_DAYS` does not move them. They are swept hourly with the
  events, on fixed clocks: what the Clone read to make a call
  (`understudy_snapshots`) goes at **30 days**; the bare fact that it wrote
  something (`understudy_ledger` stubs), a proposal once it has been answered
  (`understudy_proposals`), a queued task once it has been taken or worked
  (`understudy_asked`), a named agent once its window has ended
  (`named_agent`), what a session was to the app (`session_role`), a scheduled
  start once it has fired or been cancelled (`agent_schedule`) and a question
  once it has been answered (`understudy_help`) all go at **90 days**. What
  never expires is the part that is still owed to a person or still the score:
  a *pending* proposal, a *queued* task, a *waiting* schedule, an *open*
  question, and the ledger's `decision` and `fence` rows. Three more tables —
  shifts that are not running (`understudy_shifts`), acts that have been undone
  (`understudy_acts`) and runs that are not running (`understudy_work`) — go at
  90 days too, except that **`AGENTGLASS_RETENTION_DAYS=0` keeps them for
  ever**: they are the record of what ran unattended, and turning event pruning
  off is read as wanting that record kept. A shift, an act not yet undone, or a
  run still marked running is never swept, because "started, never finished" is
  the only trace of an agent killed mid-task.

To get rid of any of it, delete the files. Stop the server first — SQLite is
open while it runs:

```sh
rm -rf ~/.local/share/agentglass ~/.config/agentglass
```

Removing only the history and keeping your settings means deleting the `.db`
alone. Nothing else in the app depends on it; the next event starts a new one.

## Out of scope

agentglass is a tool you point at your own machine, so the boundary is
provenance, not symptom. **A surface you deliberately opened, doing something
to the machine you opened it on, is the tool working.** In particular:

- The terminal, the chat panes and the Docker controls run **as you**, with your
  permissions. Filling the disk, killing a process, removing your own container
  or running a destructive command through them is not a vulnerability — it is
  the capability, and each one has a switch in the table below.
- The gate is **fail-open by default and by design**. An agent proceeding
  because nobody answered in time, or because agentglass was not running, is
  documented behaviour; `AGENTGLASS_GATE_FAILCLOSED=1` inverts it. Nor is it a
  boundary against a process running as you — see
  [What the gate does not protect against](#what-the-gate-does-not-protect-against),
  which says so before a report has to. A local process that sets an `Origin`
  header in order to release its own hold on a server started by hand, where no
  desk holds a key, is that same case, and that section says so in as many
  words rather than leaving it to be discovered.
- Recorded data staying recorded (above) is a retention decision, not a leak.
- Findings that require an attacker to already have a shell on the machine, or
  to already hold the token, are not separate issues — at that point they have
  what the token protects.

What **is** in scope is anything that crosses a boundary without you: a webpage
reaching the server, another machine reaching it without the token, a repository
you cloned redirecting your transcripts, one project's scope reading another's
data, or a path that escapes the active scope.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not open a public issue** for security problems.

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting instead:
**[Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/SirAllap/agentglass/security/advisories/new)** —
it opens a private thread with the maintainer.

Please include:

- What an attacker can do, and from where (same machine · LAN · a webpage the
  user visits — e.g. anything that bypasses the origin guard on mutating routes)
- Steps or a proof-of-concept to reproduce
- The commit/version you tested

You can expect an acknowledgement within a few days. Once a fix ships, the
report can be published as an advisory with credit to you (unless you prefer to
stay anonymous).

## Writing to somebody else's board

Reading ClickUp needs only the token. **Changing** anything there — moving a card
to another status, putting yourself on it — is off unless you set
`AGENTGLASS_CLICKUP_WRITE=1`, and that default is the opposite of the one the
local task list uses. The reason is the blast radius rather than the risk of a
bug: your Taskwarrior store is yours, while a status change on a company board
fires automations, notifies a team, and cannot be undone from here.

With it on, each change still asks first — naming the card and what will change
from and to — and re-reads the card immediately beforehand, refusing if somebody
moved it while you had it open. That check is `date_updated`, which is the
closest thing ClickUp offers to a precondition; it is weaker than the fingerprint
the local list uses, and it catches the case that actually happens.

Values are offered, never typed: a status can only be one the list itself
accepts, so an invalid one cannot be sent. And there are no bulk actions here on
purpose — one wrong batch is thirty notifications to other people.

## Reading outside the open project

Everything under `/files/` is bounded by the open project: a cockpit pointed at
one repository refuses a path that is not in it, so scoping narrows what you can
*touch* and not only what you can *see*.

The finder's **Machine** tab is the one deliberate exception, because "where is
that document" is asked about files that are in no checkout — a ticket's
evidence folder, a note in `~/Documents`. It is bounded separately, in
`server/src/disk.ts`, and the bounds are narrow:

- **your home directory and nothing above it.** Another root can be added with
  `AGENTGLASS_DISK_ROOTS` (`:`-separated), which is an operator's decision.
- **nothing hidden.** A dotted path component is refused, for searching and for
  reading — `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.config/<app>` and every credentials file
  that lives in one. The rule is the dot rather than a list of names.
- **symlinks are resolved before the path is judged**, so a shortcut in your
  home directory cannot point out of it.
- **`AGENTGLASS_DISK_DISABLED=1` turns it off**, and so does
  `AGENTGLASS_FS_BROWSE_DISABLED=1` — disabling the file browser must not leave
  a second door standing.

Three details of the same boundary, because each was once wrong:

- **`/preview/raw` and `/preview/open` judge the real path.** Symlinks are
  resolved *before* the scope check, and what is then read or handed to the
  desktop opener is that resolved path — never the spelling that passed. Both
  are refused outright under `AGENTGLASS_FS_BROWSE_DISABLED=1`.
- **`/disk/find` and `/disk/grep` pass the query after `--`**, so a search
  string that begins with a dash is a search string to `fd`, `rg` and `grep`,
  not an option that changes where they look.
- **`/docker/volume/peek` runs `busybox` or `alpine` and nothing else.** Looking
  inside a volume means mounting it into a throwaway container, and the image
  that container runs is matched against those two names; if neither is already
  local the peek is refused rather than pulled or substituted.

The boundary is covered by `server/test/disk-scope.test.ts`; a regression there
is a hole rather than a bug, and it would not show up in a screenshot.

## Plugins

A plugin is a folder with a `plugin.json`, copied to
`~/.config/agentglass/plugins/<name>/` by `POST /plugins/install` (or
`/plugins/install-from-catalogue`) and run only after a person has read what it
declares and pressed enable — nothing in the folder executes at install, and the
master switch (`/plugins/master`) stops every plugin at once.
[docs/PLUGINS.md](docs/PLUGINS.md) is the long form; the security facts are these.

A plugin runs as **its own process**, started by this server with four
variables in its environment (`PATH`, `HOME`, `AGENTGLASS_URL`,
`AGENTGLASS_READ_TOKEN`) and nothing inherited. **On a host that can build a
`bwrap` box it runs in one** (its own folder, the app's address and what its
`sandbox` block lists; no internet by default); elsewhere it runs as you, and
the scope limits that token, not the process. The token is minted at enable
time at the scope the manifest asked for — `read`, `answer` or `full`, the same
three a paired device has — lives only in the server's memory, and is revoked
when the plugin is disabled or the process exits. What was approved is a
fingerprint over the scope and a content hash of every file in the folder, so an
update that changes the manifest, or changes the code behind an unchanged
manifest, clears the approval and asks again.

**A plugin token is its own kind of caller and can never answer a permission
gate**, whatever scope it declares or was granted. `POST /gate/decide` asks for
a credential no process on this machine could have minted for itself; a plugin's
token sits in a process environment on this machine, readable by any agent
running as the same user — exactly what the gate holds — so `auth.ts` names the
kind and refuses it. `answer` for a plugin means replying to a running session,
not releasing one.

Two path rules and one network rule hold the install itself. A `name` that is
`.`, `..` or begins with a dot is refused before anything is copied. Every path
the installer removes or copies to is asserted to sit under the plugins root
(`insidePluginsRoot`), so a manifest cannot steer a delete elsewhere. A
catalogue (`GET /plugins/catalogue?url=`) is fetched over `https://` only, through
the same guarded fetch the server uses for any address it did not choose: each
hop is checked against private, loopback and link-local ranges before it is
connected to, redirects are followed one hop at a time with that check repeated,
five hops at most, and a body over 5 MB or a fetch over 15 seconds is dropped.
Private addresses are recognised in every spelling of an IPv4 host inside an
IPv6 address (`::ffff:127.0.0.1` and `::ffff:7f00:1` alike, NAT64 and 6to4
too), and the connection is made to the address that was checked rather than to
a second lookup of the name.

## The Clone, unattended

The Clone (the *understudy* in the code and the routes) takes a task from a
queue, cuts a worktree of its own, seats an agent in it and lets the tests
decide. It never pushes. Because nobody is watching while it works, what the
agent inherits is fenced rather than trusted.

**The environment fence** (`server/src/understudy-runenv.ts`) builds the run's
environment by copying the server's and blanking, by name, `GH_TOKEN`,
`GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`, `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, `AGENTGLASS_WEBHOOK` and
`AGENTGLASS_TOKEN`, then every variable whose name matches `*_TOKEN`, `*_KEY`,
`*_API_KEY`, `*_SECRET`, `*_PASSWORD`, `*_PASS`, `*_CREDENTIAL(S)`, `AWS_*`,
`AZURE_*`, `GOOGLE_APPLICATION*`, `OPENAI_*`, `CLICKUP*`, `SLACK_*`, `DISCORD_*`,
`NPM_TOKEN`, `PYPI*` or `DOCKER_*` (case-insensitive). The one exception is
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, which is the key the fenced CLI itself spends. `gh` is
pointed at an empty, run-private config directory, git's credential helper is
emptied and every `https://`, `git@` and `ssh://` push URL is rewritten to an
address that does not resolve, so a push cannot succeed even if the agent tries
one. Into that fenced environment the run receives **one credential of its
own**: a per-run token (`AGENTGLASS_TOKEN` and `AGENTGLASS_READ_TOKEN` both name
it) minted for the run and revoked when it ends, graded not by scope but by a
short positive allowlist — every read, and only the writes the Clone owns; it
can neither release a gate nor start a session.

**The private-terms gate** keeps the material the Clone learns from
(`POST /understudy/learn`: notes, transcripts, shell history, rules) and the
judge's prompt free of names that must not leave a private repository. The list
is one pattern per line at `~/.config/agentglass/private-terms.txt`;
`AGENTGLASS_PRIVATE_TERMS` names another file; and when the app's own list is
absent a git hook's list at `~/.config/git/private-terms.txt` is honoured, since
a person who keeps one there has already said what is private. Without any list
the Clone refuses to read at all. The one override is explicit consent — the
desktop's *"Read anyway — nothing here is private"*, sent as
`iAcceptNoTermsList: true` from the desktop's own origin and from nowhere else.
A hit is recorded as an index into the list, never as the term.

**The judge** — `claude -p` asked whether the Clone's call matched the person's
— is **off by default** (the `judge` setting) and declines to run without a
private-terms list. When it runs it does so in a room of its own: a fresh
directory under the app's state directory created `0700`, with its own
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` beside it (also `0700`), never under `/tmp`, so the model's
hooks, settings and working files are the app's rather than whatever the
person's own `claude` would load.

**Seeding a worktree** from `.worktreeinclude` copies only files git ignores,
skips anything tracked, never overwrites what git put there, refuses a line that
climbs out of the repository, and never copies through or as a symlink — every
path component is `lstat`ed without following, and the `.worktreeinclude` file
itself must be a regular file.

## The Lantern, and agents with names

**The Lantern** is an observer. `GET /agents/board` reads every hooked session
on this machine; `GET`/`POST /lantern/settings` holds two switches
(`lanternWatch`, `lanternWatchMinutes`) that make the server re-read that board
every N minutes on its own and send one notification when somebody is still
stopped on you, a named agent's window has vanished, or claimed work has gone
quiet. A notification goes wherever the app's alerts go: the bell in the app, a
paired phone on the socket it holds, the desktop otherwise, and
`AGENTGLASS_WEBHOOK` when one is set (see below). The Lantern's own chat is on
the board as `role: "lantern"` and is never counted as needing you; a status
line posted by it is accepted and dropped. It starts nothing and stops nothing.

**`POST /agents/status`** is how a session says what it is working on, and it is
**tokenless on loopback by design**: the shipped hook carries it and a hook has
no token to give. It still passes the origin check. Its free-text fields are
capped at the door — `name`, `worktree`, `branch` and `session` at 512
characters, `doing` and `left` at 4096 — and trimmed again before storage, so a
runaway agent cannot fill the database through it. `{name, done: true}` removes
a line, and only the session that wrote the line may remove it: no `session` is
a 400, another session's is a 403.

**Named agents** (`GET /agents/named`, `POST /agents/named/{start,prompt,wait,
read,keys,stop}`) and **schedules** (`GET`/`POST /agents/schedule`,
`POST /agents/schedule/cancel`) seat a CLI by name in a checkout of the open
project, now or at a time. Two rules hold whatever the caller passes. The
skip-permissions mode (`--yolo`) is granted only if Settings allow it
(`chatBypass`, or `AGENTGLASS_CHAT_BYPASS=1`), and a schedule checks that
**again when it fires**, not only when it was written. And extra CLI arguments
are refused when they are permission-shaped: any vendor's bypass flag, anything
beginning `--dangerously-`, anything containing *bypass*, *skip-permission*,
*dangerous*, *yolo* or *full-auto*, and `--permission-mode`, `--settings`,
`--mcp-config`, `--sandbox`/`-s`, `-a`/`--ask-for-approval`, `-y`,
`--approval-mode`, `--auto`, `--approve-for-me`, `--allowedTools`,
`--allowed-tools`, `--disallowedTools`, `--disallowed-tools`, `--add-dir` and
`--include-directories`, and for Codex alone `-p`/`--profile` (a profile can
set the approval policy; Claude's `-p` is print mode). A refused one-letter flag counts inside a group or with
its value glued on (`-cy`, `-anever`). A Codex config override, `-c key=value`
or `--config key=value` in any of its spellings (one word or two, quoted or
not, glued), is refused when its key touches the approval policy, the sandbox,
permissions, a project's trust level, a profile or MCP servers. The refusal is
a 400 that names the flag; nothing is silently dropped. What an agent is
allowed to do is decided in Settings, not in the arguments of the request that
starts it.

A **worker role** (`start --role`) adds a lock: a deny list of publishing,
history-rewriting and network commands, handed to the CLI in its own rule
syntax. On OpenCode the lock is merged with the directory's config, so each
start asks OpenCode for the merged rules and refuses when a project rule wins
over the lock. The lock is a list of command prefixes, not a sandbox. A project
**OpenCode plugin** (`.opencode/plugin/`, or one named in the project's
opencode.json) is arbitrary code that OpenCode runs inside the worker, and the
lock does not cover it: a plugin can run any command itself without asking the
permission system. A role on OpenCode is only as locked as the plugins in that
checkout are trusted.

## The browser, driven by an agent

`bin/agentglass-browser` and `bin/agentglass-browser-mcp` drive the app's own
built-in browser through the server's relay (`POST /browser/<verb>`), so an
agent reaches the page the person is looking at — signed in as they are — and
nothing else: the app's own renderer, and the token in it, are not on the other
side of that relay. This is why the app is never started with a remote
debugging port.

That is also why there is no DevTools-protocol endpoint for Puppeteer,
Playwright or a browser-use-style framework to connect to, and none is planned
as a default. A raw protocol session is agent-supplied code on every page the
browser holds, and it goes under everything this section describes — the URL
policy, the allow-lists, read-only mode, the ownership check between agents,
the redaction and the audit line per verb all sit above the verb, and a socket
sits below it. What an agent that speaks the protocol gets instead is
`browser_cdp`: one command at a time, through the relay, audited, and refused
under read-only mode. If a drop-in is ever built it will be opt-in, scoped to
one container, bound to loopback with a token, alive only while the process
that asked for it is — and a decision made in the open, not a port that
happens to be on.

Some of those verbs **act**. `browser_eval` runs JavaScript in the page,
`browser_addInitScript` installs JavaScript that runs before every page does,
`browser_expose` gives the page a function that calls back into the agent, and
`browser_cdp` sends raw DevTools Protocol commands to the page's session. All
four are confined to the guest page, and all four — with clicking, typing, and
every other verb not in the observe list — are refused under
`AGENTGLASS_BROWSER_READONLY=1`, which leaves reading, screenshots and the
network log working.

`upload` attaches a file from this machine to a page, so it is bounded like a
read of the disk: a path is admitted only if the open project admits it, or (with
no project open) it is under your home directory and not hidden, or the
machine-search roots (`AGENTGLASS_DISK_ROOTS`) admit it — and never `~/.ssh`,
`~/.gnupg`, `~/.aws` or the app's own config directory, checked against the
spelling and against the resolved path. It honours `AGENTGLASS_DISK_DISABLED=1`
and `AGENTGLASS_FS_BROWSE_DISABLED=1` as refusals. The MCP server does not
offer `ignoreCertErrors` at all. Both CLIs refuse to send the token over plain
`http://` to any host that is not loopback — `https://` anywhere, `http://`
only to this machine — before a single request is built. Cookies, storage
state, HAR files and page snapshots the CLI writes land as `0600` files.

Where the browser may be sent is held twice. The relay judges the literal host
of every `open` before the browser sees it — `http(s)` only, and never
link-local (169.254/16, where a cloud's metadata endpoint lives) or the
unspecified address; loopback and LAN addresses are allowed on purpose, since a
dev server on this machine is ordinary use. A hostname cannot be judged there,
because the browser resolves it again when it connects and a name may answer
differently the second time. So the desktop app also runs an **egress guard**:
a proxy on a loopback port that every browsing session is pointed at, which
resolves each name once per connection, refuses any answer in those ranges,
opens the socket to the address it judged, reaches a name that answers a public
and a private address in one set at the public ones only, and refuses a name
that has ever answered a public address when it later answers a private or
loopback one — the DNS rebinding shapes. A public name is remembered for the
life of the app and never forgotten to make room; when the memory is full (100k
names) a new public name is refused by name rather than let through unpinned,
for every tab until a restart. The memory does not survive a restart, while a
persistent profile's service workers and cache do: a page kept from an earlier
run meets a guard that has not seen its name yet. A name that has only ever
answered private (a hosts-file entry, a LAN box) is judged fresh every time and
stays allowed, so nothing about local development changes.
`AGENTGLASS_BROWSER_EGRESS=off` turns the guard off; a proxy set through the
`session` verb replaces it while set, and the verb says so — which is also the
ceiling: an agent with the `session` verb can replace the guard with a direct
rule before it opens a name, and the reply says the guard is off rather than
refusing. The verb is one that acts, so read-only mode refuses it.

The guard is about **names**, not a private-network firewall: it refuses a
*name* that has ever answered public from later answering private or
loopback, but a public page's own subresources can still request a loopback
or LAN address written as a literal — Chromium sends those straight through,
without the proxy. What the guard closes is the rebinding trick where a name
changes its answer after being trusted; a page that already knows the address
it wants does not need the name to lie.

### The cockpit over MCP

`bin/agentglass-cockpit-mcp` answers questions about the cockpit's own data —
sessions, spend, tool latency, errors, the agent board, pending gates — and
nothing else. It reaches the app only with GET requests (one request is built
in the file, and a test holds it to GET), so no argument makes it write, kill
or approve.

What it reads is what the app's token reads, and that is a lot. For every
session in scope: its title, project, model and spend, and which of its tool
calls failed recently. The agent board, with what each agent says it is
doing. Every held gate, with the tool and the call it holds. And, through
`cockpit_session`, a session's own text: its conversation, each message up
to 20,000 characters; its timeline, with each tool's output up to 4,000
characters — a `printenv`, a `cat` of a config file; its file changes with
their diffs; its first prompt and its last answer. And, through
`cockpit_errors`, the text of its failed tool calls, up to 2,000 characters.

That text comes for the caller's own session only: the one Claude Code names
in `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` when it starts the server over stdio — inherited,
so any other client started from inside that session takes it as its own too.
Another session's is left out, and the answer says what it withheld and why, unless
`AGENTGLASS_COCKPIT_TRANSCRIPTS=all` is set. Over HTTP no session is the
caller's own, so there it takes that setting too, and with it on, anyone
holding the cockpit token reads every session's text.

The gate ids it lists do not release anything by themselves: on a server the
desktop app started, letting a hold go takes the app's key or a paired device,
and elsewhere the `Origin` rule and its limit apply (see
[The one on that list that was a bug](#the-one-on-that-list-that-was-a-bug)).

This is the tool's default, not a boundary. The app token the cockpit carries
reads `/session` directly, as the desk does, so any process holding that token
— an agent's own shell included — reads every transcript without going through
this server. What the default stops is the agent that asks its tools rather
than writing a `curl`: the helpful one, and the one an injected instruction
sends to read its neighbours.

Over HTTP it runs behind the browser MCP server's transport, imported rather
than copied: a loopback bind unless `--expose`, any `Origin` refused, only
`application/json` bodies, and a bearer of its own, `AGENTGLASS_COCKPIT_TOKEN`,
refused at start if it equals the app's token or the browser endpoint's. A
cockpit token that leaks reads the cockpit; it does not drive the browser or
open the app. Its bind and expose variables are its own as well, so setting
the browser endpoint's never starts or exposes this one.

## What leaves through the webhook

`AGENTGLASS_WEBHOOK` is off unless set. With it set, the server POSTs
`{"text": …}` to that one URL (a Slack- or Discord-shaped incoming webhook) in
three cases, and this is everything that travels:

- **Alerts** — the same title and body the desktop notification carries: a
  gate waiting on you, a reminder, the Clone stuck on a question, and the
  Lantern's watch notices, which name agents, the base name of a checkout,
  what an agent said it was working on, and the reason a permission prompt or a
  held gate gave — each line cut at 200 characters.
- **Pull-request nudges** — `POST /prs/nudge` with `send: true` posts the chase
  it wrote: the reviewers' logins as `@`-handles, the PR number, its title, a
  phrase for what is being asked (a first look, another look, a re-check), and
  the PR's URL.

No transcript, no diff and no token goes through it, and the variable is blanked
out of every Clone run so an unattended agent cannot post through it either.

Where it may point is checked once, at boot, and the host it resolved to is
printed then — so nothing is being sent somewhere you do not know about.
Loopback and the two hosts the feature exists for (`hooks.slack.com`,
`discord.com`) are accepted as they are; any other destination needs
`AGENTGLASS_ALLOW_REMOTE=1`, and without it the channel is refused rather than
posted to. What is logged is the host, never the path — a webhook URL's path
*is* its credential.

## Hardening knobs

Each capability has its own switch — see the README's configuration table for
the full list and defaults:

| Knob | Turns off |
|---|---|
| `AGENTGLASS_TERMINAL_DISABLED` | PTY shells (also `"terminalDisabled"` in `config.json`; always off on Windows) |
| `AGENTGLASS_CHAT_DISABLED` | starting `claude` sessions from the browser |
| `AGENTGLASS_GIT_WRITE_DISABLED` | git mutations **and** every pull-request action |
| `AGENTGLASS_DOCKER_WRITE_DISABLED` | container start/stop/restart/rm |
| `AGENTGLASS_COMMIT_DISABLED` | the diff viewer's commit composer |
| `AGENTGLASS_FS_BROWSE_DISABLED` | directory completion in the project picker, and everything under `/files/` and `/disk/` |
| `AGENTGLASS_DISK_DISABLED` | the finder's **Machine** tab: searching and reading documents under your home directory |
| `AGENTGLASS_EDITOR_DISABLED` | opening a file in your editor from the app |
| `AGENTGLASS_SCAN_DISABLED` | the machine-wide transcript scanner |
| `AGENTGLASS_WALKTHROUGH_DISABLED` | the AI **Explain** walkthrough, whatever provider is available |
| `AGENTGLASS_BROWSER_READONLY` | every acting verb of the built-in browser when an agent drives it — clicks, typing, `eval`, `cdp`, init scripts, uploads — leaving reads and screenshots |
| `AGENTGLASS_BUDGET_WRITE_DISABLED` | changing spend budgets from the app (`POST /budgets/set`) |
| `AGENTGLASS_TASK_WRITE_DISABLED` | writes to your Taskwarrior list from the Tasks view |
| `AGENTGLASS_UNDERSTUDY=0` | the Clone, whatever its settings file says — the variable can force it off, never on |
| `AGENTGLASS_TMUX_OBSERVE_ONLY` | every tmux command that writes to a session — see [docs/BLAST-RADIUS.md](docs/BLAST-RADIUS.md) |
| `AGENTGLASS_CLICKUP_WRITE=1` | *(opposite sense)* turns **on** writes to a ClickUp board, which are off by default |
| `AGENTGLASS_GATE_FAILCLOSED=1` | *(opposite sense)* makes the gate deny on timeout instead of allowing |

One thing is **not** individually switchable, and it is worth knowing which:
the `/control` UI-navigation endpoint, which is unswitchable by design — it
grants no capability the keyboard does not already have.

Beyond the knobs, **scope is itself a boundary**: with a project open, git
writes and git reads, the terminal, chat, pull-request actions and editor opens
are all refused outside it.

**Git never takes a command from a repository it merely found.** Every git call
the server makes runs with `safe.bareRepository=explicit`, so a directory that
only looks like a repository (committed as ordinary files inside a project) is
not one, and with `core.fsmonitor=false`; reads also run with hooks off. A real
checkout's own `.git/config` is still yours and is honoured as your terminal
honours it — that is the limit.

## What it can do to your tmux

agentglass attaches to the tmux server you already run rather than starting one
of its own, which means it can write to sessions it did not create — resize a
window, rename it, move it, switch your client. That is a capability, not a
vulnerability, but it is one worth being able to look up rather than discover.
[docs/BLAST-RADIUS.md](docs/BLAST-RADIUS.md) lists every such command, what
triggers it, and the `AGENTGLASS_TMUX_OBSERVE_ONLY=1` switch that turns all of
them off while leaving the read-only cockpit working.

## The phone app and plain http

The native app keeps cleartext http allowed for every host. Pairing over a bare
LAN or tailnet address is plain http, Android's network security config cannot
scope cleartext by address range, and the pairing token is the protection, not
the transport (see the handshake above: the credential is sealed to the phone's
key). The config does restrict https to the system certificate store, so a
certificate authority installed on the phone cannot vouch for a host.
