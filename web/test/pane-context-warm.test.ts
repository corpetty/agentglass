/*
 * "It takes ages to analyse and show the drawer with the PR, card, git and diff…
 * especially after restarting agentglass… it stays on Reading this pane…
 * now they have loaded, after a good while."
 *
 * Two cold starts, one on top of the other.
 *
 *  1. The route answers about the pane tmux has SELECTED, so the panel could
 *     only ask about a pane after selecting it: one round trip per pane, made
 *     as the pointer reached it. On a six-pane grid that is six discoveries,
 *     one at a time, each one behind a "Reading this pane…".
 *  2. The answer lived in the component, so a relaunch threw away everything
 *     the last hour had learned.
 *
 * So the window is asked for in one request while nobody is waiting, and what
 * it learns is written down. What makes writing it down safe is `nextSeen`: an
 * entry survives only while the SAME agent is still in that pane.
