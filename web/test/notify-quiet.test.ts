// agentglass reads notifications off the D-Bus session bus instead of being the
// daemon, so the desktop's own Do Not Disturb cannot reach what lands on the
// notch. Verified live: with DND on, WhatsApp messages the desktop silently
// queued were still shown, body and all. Quiet is agentglass's own answer to
// that, since the OS state is not portably readable.
//
// The line these defend is the one that makes quiet safe to use: it silences
// other people's messages, and it must never be able to silence a gate hold,
// because that would turn "do not interrupt me" into "an agent blocked and
// nobody said". That separation is structural (a hold does not travel the
// mirrored-notes path at all) and these pin it so a refactor cannot merge the
// two lanes by accident.
