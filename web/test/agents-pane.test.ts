/*
 * The agents pane, and the one distinction it exists to make.

 * A config that was written and an event that arrived are different facts, and
 * every failure in this area looks like the first: a file in the right shape a
 * CLI does not read, a session started before the change, a typo in an
 * endpoint. A tick over a file that changed nothing stops the search, which is
 * worse than no tick at all.
