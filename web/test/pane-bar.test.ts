/*
 * The bar a pane keeps under its own bottom edge.
 *
 * What stood here before was a 2×2 block of icon-only doors in the pane's
 * corner. It reached the right pane — that was the point, and it worked — but
 * four glyphs cannot say WHICH pull request or WHICH card they open, and every
 * attempt to add that inside the block turned the corner of a terminal into a
 * paragraph. "We no longer need the drawer, just the bar."
 *
 * So: a seam across the pane's foot, and a bar that rises out of it when the
 * pointer is there. Three halves are tested — the arithmetic that finds a
 * pane's foot on a rectangle of character cells, the cut that keeps a branch
 * name readable at any width, and the bar itself.
