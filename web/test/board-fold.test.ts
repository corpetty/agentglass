/*
 * A folded lane gives back its width and keeps its number.
 *
 * The board demands `5 × 268 + 4 × 10 + 32 = 1412` CSS pixels. His screen at
 * 175% zoom leaves 1170 — which is why the cards in his screenshot wrap to two
 * lines and the last one is cut off by the column's edge. A lane folded from
 * 268 to 44 gives back 224 plus its gap, so TWO folded lanes bring the minimum
 * under 1000: below his real width, with no breakpoint and nothing moving on
 * its own.
 *
 * FOLDING IS NOT FILTERING, and this board already refused that twice in
 * writing. Eight printed numbers derive from the flattened partition rather
 * than from what is drawn — the headline "22 of 391", the "9 can land right
 * now", each segment count, the footer. If a fold subtracted, all eight go
 * wrong at once and the footer becomes a lie: those pull requests still want
 * something from you, you just stopped looking. Every fold in this app that
 * hides something countable keeps the number on the folded header, and one of
 * them states it as law: "the count is the whole point of a folded row".
 *
 * Rendered, not read from source, because these are claims about what ends up
 * on screen. The stubs go in before the import and come back out after: one
 * process runs every file in this suite, and a `localStorage` left behind is
 * one the next file inherits.
