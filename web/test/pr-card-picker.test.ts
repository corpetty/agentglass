/*
 * The reviewer menu and the card it also moves — four faults from one sitting,
 * each pinned here.
 *
 * Reported together, with screenshots: ticking a reviewer assigned them without
 * Done ever being pressed; the ClickUp people went back to how they were a few
 * seconds later; the confirmation promised a move and two assignments and only
 * one of them happened; and opening the menu again a while later left the whole
 * window black.
 *
 * These read `PrPanel.tsx` as text, which is a weak kind of test and the honest
 * one available here: three of the four are invariants about WHERE code sits —
 * hooks above a conditional return, a dependency that is a string rather than
 * an object — and there is no DOM under `bun test` to re-render a component in.
 * The behaviour they protect is measured in card-plan.test.ts and, on the
 * server, in clickup.test.ts.
 *
 * Worth saying plainly: this repository has no eslint, so
 * `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` — which is exactly the rule the black window
 * broke — has never run over it. The `eslint-disable` comments in the source
 * are addressed to a linter that is not installed.
