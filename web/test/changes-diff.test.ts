// not a line of it — every other diff parser in the app drops it — but the two
// row builders keyed off the first character and, seeing anything but +/-,
// counted it as a context line. That painted a phantom row reading " No newline
// at end of file" AND advanced the old/new gutters, so every line number below
// it was off by one.
