/*
 * An icon is drawn, never typed.
 *
 * The app had over two hundred icons that were characters: emoji (`⚙ 💬 🔒 📌
 * ⏰`) that draw in colour at whatever size the system's emoji font picks, and
 * symbols (`⇄ ☑ ✳ ◍ ⌕ ✎ ⎇ ✦`) that paint about 60% of their font size — beside
 * the line icons of the rail, in the same row. On a desktop whose emoji font is
 * not the one this was built on, a menu of them read as a sticker sheet.
 *
 * Every one of these characters now has a line icon in lib/glyphIcons.tsx or
 * workspace/icons.tsx. This fails when one comes back as text in a component.
 *
 * What stays text, and why, is listed rather than guessed at:
 *   - GitHub's reactions and markdown emoji shortcodes are CONTENT the person
 *     wrote, not the app's chrome;
 *   - the diff's change column (`− → ± ⧉`) is a code, like a git status letter.
 * Keys in shortcut hints (`⌘ ⏎ ⌫`), arrows inside a sentence and status dots
 * are not in the set at all.
