/*
 * Where "find on this screen" points, which is the whole of this feature.

 * The searching itself is `mdFind`, already pinned down next door. What is new
 * — and what would break silently — is the answer to WHERE: the workspace keeps
 * every visited view mounted and merely hides the inactive ones, and thirty
 * components render through a portal into `document.body`. Get the scope wrong
 * and the bar counts matches in a view nobody is looking at, which is the exact
 * failure it was built to end.
 *
 * No DOM in this runner, so the scopes are stand-ins and the engine is a fake.
 * That is not a compromise here: the stack and the state machine ARE the logic,
 * and the DOM walk is tested by the suite next to it.
