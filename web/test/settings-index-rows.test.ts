/*
 * settingsRows.gen.ts is generated from the settings pages themselves — see

 * after editing a label is worse than a hand-kept list: it LOOKS derived, so
 * nobody double-checks it the way they would a paragraph they typed.
 *
 * This runs the generator into a scratch file and diffs it against the
 * committed one, the same "does it still say what building it would say"
 * check tranche-floors.txt itself makes CLAUDE.md carry a comment about.
