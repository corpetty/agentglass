/**
 * A server that dies before the banner subscribes is still reported.
 *
 * The preload reads the shell's verdict once, as the page loads, and the push
 * after that reaches only listeners that exist. A server that exits on its
 * first line fails in the gap between the two: after the preload's read (null,
 * nothing decided yet) and before React has mounted the banner and subscribed.
 * Measured on the packaged shell with a database it could not open: the window
 * sat on "Reading the working tree…" with no banner, and the same page showed
 * the failure at once when reloaded.
