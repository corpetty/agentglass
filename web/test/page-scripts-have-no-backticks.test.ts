/*
 * A backtick inside a page script ends the template literal that builds it.
 *
 * Three times in one evening — once by the clone, twice by hand — a comment
 * written INSIDE one of these template literals quoted an identifier with
 * backticks, the way every other comment in this repo does, and silently
 * closed the string. What comes back is a parse error tens of lines away
 * about a word from the middle of an English sentence.
 *
 * THE HISTORY OF THIS LOCK, because it is the point:
 *
 *   1. Counting backticks across the file. Passed while the file was broken —
 *      an even number is not the same fact as a correct one.
 *   2. Importing the module to see whether it parsed. HUNG rather than
 *      failing, which is worse than no check: a hang reads as a slow suite.
 *   3. Hand-tracking which characters sit inside a template. Reported THIRTY
 *      FIVE violations in a file that compiled cleanly — every ordinary
 *      TypeScript comment that quoted an identifier desynchronised it. A lock
 *      with false positives is worse than no lock, because it asks people to
 *      "fix" healthy code and teaches them to ignore it.
 *
 * So it asks the transpiler, which is the only thing here that actually knows
 * where a template starts and ends. It cannot name the line — the parse error
 * never points at the real one anyway — but it is never wrong about whether
 * the file is broken, and the comment above tells whoever hits it what to
 * look for.

   * letter-s collapse, and the only symptom is text that looks slightly wrong

   * turned "Save changes" into "Save change" and nobody noticed, because the
