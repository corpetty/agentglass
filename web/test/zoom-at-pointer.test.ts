/*
 * The gesture picks its target by where the pointer is, and a web page is one
 * of the targets.
 *
 * The rule this module exists for had two answers — a terminal, or the window
 * — and a page in the browser panel fell into "the window". Measured on the
 * running app with the pointer over the page, Ctrl+ twice: the window's
 * devicePixelRatio went 1.25 -> 1.5625 and the page came back at innerWidth
 * 2790, exactly what it started at.
 *
 * The second half is subtler and cost a whole build to find: the first fix
 * asked `elementFromPoint(x, y)?.closest("webview")`, the way the terminal is
 * asked. Measured on the running app, the point at the centre of the guest
 * comes back as a DIV — the panel lays its own surfaces over the guest — so
 * that branch was false everywhere on the page and never ran once. A `<webview>`
 * is a hole with another process behind it; the only thing this document can
 * honestly say about it is where it is. Hence the rectangle.
