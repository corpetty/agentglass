/*
 * settings-search-reaches-every-row.test.ts checks that a row's words are
 * indexed at all; this drives the actual ranking a query gets, the same way
 * it always has, now through `pageScore` (settingsIndex.ts) instead of the
 * `tabScore` this file used to pull out of SettingsModal.tsx's source with a
 * transpile-and-eval — `pageScore` is an ordinary exported function, so
 * there is nothing left to extract.
 *
 * `pageScore` additionally scores every ROW on a page, not just its title and
 * `kw` bag, so a query naming a row now reaches its page even when the page's
 * OWN `kw` bag does not happen to carry that exact word — which is what
 * "notification sound" answering `prefs` (Window) used to depend on, back
 * when `kw` was the only index there was and Window's `kw` still listed
 * "sound" for a row Notifications now owns. That entry is gone from `kw`
 * (see settings-search-sound.test.ts); the row itself is what carries it.
