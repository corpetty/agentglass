 * Browsing as somebody else.
 *
 * The last thing on the browser's list after it was rebuilt: Orca has "New
 * Profile…", this had one Chromium partition, so signing into a site as
 * yourself and as a test user meant signing out in between.
 *
 * Almost all of the mechanism is Chromium's — a partition IS a profile. What is
 * ours, and what is here, is the naming: which suffix a tab attaches on, what
 * happens to the default one, and the rule that the main process will refuse
 * anything outside the family. That last one is the reason `partitionFor` and
 * `isProfileId` are not "just string helpers": a profile id decides which
 * cookie jar a page can read.
