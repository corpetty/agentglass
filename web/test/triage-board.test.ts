/*
 * What the board actually draws.
 *
 * prLanes.ts is already pinned down by its own suite — which lane a pull
 * request belongs in, and why. This file is about the layer above it, and about
 * the failures that layer has: the ones that are silent. A lane that quietly
 * stops counting the pull requests it is holding back, a cap that stops capping,
 * a scope sentence whose numbers drift apart from the lists they came from, and
 * a board that says "nothing here" while it is still asking — none of those
 * throw, none of them look wrong in a screenshot of a small repository, and all
 * of them are wrong in the one way this view exists to avoid: sounding certain.
 *
 * There is no DOM in these suites — bun test, no jsdom — so the component is
 * rendered to a string with `react-dom/server` and read as markup, the same way
 * server-banner-desktop.test.ts does it. That means no effects run: the keyboard
 * cursor, `scrollIntoView` and the reconciliation that keeps the cursor on
 * something are all effect-borne and cannot be seen from here. They are not
 * asserted, rather than asserted emptily.
