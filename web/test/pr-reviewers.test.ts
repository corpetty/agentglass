 * earlier: "has this PR been approved for me... because in the overview it looks
 * like it hasn't". It had. The approval was in the conversation, and the Overview drew a
 * red "Merging is blocked" over a list of everything standing in the way — a
 * failing check and five open threads — with no line anywhere saying a reviewer
 * had said yes.
 *
 * That is the box doing only half its job. Blocked and approved are different
 * facts about the same pull request and both are true at once: the reviewer
 * decided, and CI has not caught up. Drawing only the second answers "can I
 * merge" and silently drops "has anybody looked", which is the question a
 * person asks first and the one only a human can answer.
 *
 * A BOT'S APPROVAL IS NOT A REVIEW, and this is where that has to be enforced
 * rather than assumed. `claude` sits in the reviewer list with the same tick as
 * a person, and the rule for this repository is explicit: an auto-review is a
 * gate before the human one, never a substitute. A summary that counted it
 * would report a pull request as approved when nobody has read it.
