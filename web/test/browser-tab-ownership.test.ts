 * Two agents, one tab — the thing that must not happen again.
 *
 * "Another agent was getting into that container and putting its data on that
 * screen... the other agent was going in to take screenshots and could not,
 * because the first one kept overwriting on top." A proof-of-life run kept being
 * overwritten by an agent that believed it was isolated. It was: isolation here
 * is the TAB an identity holds, and an ask that names no tab is not
 * "unspecified" to the panel — it is "the tab in front", whoever owns it.
 *
 * The three rules that close it are pure functions in browserDrive.ts on
 * purpose. Under `bun test` there is no DOM and effects never run, so anything
 * left inside BrowserPanel's ask handler is a rule with no lock on it; the
 * wiring is checked separately at the bottom of this file, by reading the
 * handler between two landmarks rather than at a byte offset that the next
 * comment moves.
