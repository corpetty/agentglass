// The notification pane has two switches because it has two sources: the
// machine's own notifications, mirrored in, and agentglass's own events. They
// share one bell, so they have to be silenceable apart — otherwise "stop
// telling me about Slack" and "stop telling me a branch fell behind" are the
// same decision, which is how a cockpit ends up muted entirely.
//
// These pin the three rules that make the switches safe to use:
//
//   - off means "do not interrupt", never "stop keeping track": the bell's
//     list is written on a path neither switch is on;
//   - turning the mirror off and on again does not silently downgrade how much
//     of a message you had asked to see;
//   - both default the way the feature was designed to: mirroring off (it
//     reads every notification you receive), our own alerts on.
