/*
 * The decisions behind the project picker, taken out of the screen.
 *
 * The picker ticks several projects and opens them together, lists only what is
 * under the folders the person added, and remembers anything opened from
 * outside those folders so it is still on the list next time. Each of those is
 * a small rule that is easy to get subtly wrong in a component — a set compared
 * by order, a sibling folder matched by its prefix — and this repo has no DOM
 * harness, so they live in lib/projectPick.ts and are asserted here.
