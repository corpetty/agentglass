/*
 * Scroll a diff sideways and it keeps being a diff.
 *
 * Reported with two screenshots: scrolled right, the tint on the rows, the blue
 * hunk bar and everything else painted simply stopped, and past that edge there
 * was bare background with code still in it.
 *
 * Nothing was missing. Every hunk sized itself — a `max-content` grid column
 * per hunk in the unified pane, `min-width: max-content` per hunk in the split
 * one — so a file whose widest line is in hunk 1 scrolls to hunk 1's width
 * while hunk 4 stops painting at its own, several hundred pixels earlier. The
 * hunk header had it worse: a plain block is as wide as the pane, never as wide
 * as the pane's scrollWidth.
 *
 * Measured in Chrome before and after, on a pane 418px wide holding a 574px
 * file: the second hunk's rows were 70px wide and sat at x = -28 (entirely off
 * to the left) once scrolled right; afterwards every row is 516px and reaches
 * the right edge.
 *
 * The rule, and what this file holds: inside a horizontal scroller, one element
 * owns the width — `width: max-content; min-width: 100%` — and everything
 * painted inside it is a block that inherits that width. A column that has to
 * absorb the slack uses `minmax(max-content, 1fr)`, never bare `max-content`.
