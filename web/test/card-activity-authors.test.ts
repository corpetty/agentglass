/*
 * WHO DID IT, AND WHEN.
 *
 * "I miss seeing who made those changes, with avatar and name if possible, the
 * way the ClickUp website shows it… we don't need to be exact either, since maybe
 * the API doesn't send that info, but at least who and when, yes."
 *
 * So this pins the two halves of that. What the API gives — the creator, the
 * author of a comment, and how long a card sat in each status — is drawn. What
 * it does not give is SAID rather than guessed: measured on 2026-09-01 with a
 * personal token, `/task/{id}/history` and `/task/{id}/activity` are 404 on
 * both v1 and v2, and the v1 route ClickUp's own web client uses answers
 * `JWT_008 — Auth header missing`. A status change carries no user at all.
