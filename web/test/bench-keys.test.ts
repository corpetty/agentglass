/*
 * The keys and the stacking of the bench — the two things about a window that
 * floats over everything else that fail on screen and nowhere else.
 *
 * Both were measured in the running app before they were written down here.
 * The keys one is the sharper story: with the caret in a bench terminal,
 * Ctrl+Shift+P reached the app AND the pty, so the palette opened and the shell
 * got the escape sequence — and with nvim in the tab, the next characters typed
 * went into somebody's buffer (`layers.ts` became `yers.ts` and `-- INSERT --`).
 * This is a source-shape test and says so: xterm needs a DOM that `bun test`
 * does not have, so what is pinned is the seam that fixed it.
