/*
 * The spacing scale, enforced.
 *
 * The app already had a rhythm and no record of it. Measured across web/src
 * when this was written: 3,714 spacing utilities, of which 97.8% already land
 * on a 2px grid. The disorder was never the common case — it was that nothing
 * declared the grid and nothing stopped the exceptions poking through it:
 * arbitrary values on odd pixels (`py-[3px]`, `gap-[9px]`) and inline
 * `paddingLeft: 3`, neither of which any scale produces.
 *
 * So this does not invent a scale. It holds the app to its own, the same way
 * deps-catalog.test.ts holds the requirements page to what the code actually
 * runs — and for the same reason: a convention nothing checks is a convention
 * that has already drifted, quietly, in the direction of whoever was last in a
 * hurry.
 *
 * Two rules, and the second is the one that matters:
 *
 *   1. Spacing goes through Tailwind's scale, which is a 2px grid.
 *   2. An arbitrary value (`gap-[9px]`) or an inline `padding:` has to be
 *      exempt BY NAME, with a reason. That is what turns "off the scale" from
 *      something that happens into something somebody decided.
