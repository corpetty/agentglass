// The state taxonomy the fleet reads: working / waiting / stalled / errored /
// failed / idle.
//
// Two of those six are verdicts rather than observations, and the reason this
// file is table-driven is that the verdicts are only worth having if they are
// wrong ~never. A dot that says "stalled" over a healthy twenty-minute build is
// not a small cosmetic bug — it is the end of the dot, because after the second
// one nobody reads it again. So every positive case below is paired with the
// negative it could be confused with, and the negatives are the half that
// matters:
//
//   stalled   vs  a long call the evidence can vouch for   (liveness working)
//   stalled   vs  a long call nothing local can speak to   (liveness unknown)
//   stalled   vs  a stuck call that has not run long yet   (under the floor)
//   stalled   vs  a session between turns, nothing open    (no runningTool)
//   failed    vs  a run that finished clean                (Stop, no error)
//   failed    vs  a run that hit an error and recovered    (error long before)
//
// Time-relative, like derive-agents.test.ts: offsets are kept well clear of the
// thresholds (STALL 20s, IDLE 5m, WARN 5m) so the millisecond of drift between
// this file's `now` and deriveAgents' own can never flip a case.
