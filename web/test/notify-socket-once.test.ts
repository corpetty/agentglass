// Found by measurement, not by reading: a single `notify-send` put two
// identical cards on screen. The cause is a race that only exists because
// opening is asynchronous — the capability probe is a fetch, and the module
// retunes on load while the first subscriber retunes on mount, milliseconds
// apart. Both saw `ws === null`, both passed the guard, both opened. The server
// then delivered every notification down two sockets, so every Slack message
// arrived twice and landed in the bell twice, which reads as the desktop
// sending duplicates rather than as agentglass racing itself.
//
// This file is the lock on that. It stubs the socket and the probe rather than
// reaching for a server, because what is being pinned is the guard, not the
// transport.
