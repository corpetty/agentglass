/*
 * How long the terminal's chip goes on believing a worktree.
 *
 * The bug this pins, in his words: "I've cleared the claude session and the
 * top bar still shows up… what is it trusting?". It was trusting the last worktree
 * that pane's agent ever named, with no way for that trust to expire — and
 * `/clear` is exactly the case where it must, because the conversation that
 * named the branch no longer exists.
 *
 * Both directions matter and they pull against each other: forget too eagerly
 * and the chip empties itself every time an agent thinks for a minute; forget
 * too late and it names a branch nobody is on.
