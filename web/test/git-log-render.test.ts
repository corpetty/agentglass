/*
 * The log's graph column, as it is actually emitted.
 *
 * Written after shipping the same class of bug twice in one afternoon. The lane
 * maths had a suite and passed it every time; what was wrong was the BOX around
 * the drawing, which no unit test of the maths can see:
 *
 *   1. the SVG was a fixed 26px tall inside a card whose height comes from its
 *      own content, so the lines did not meet across rows;
 *   2. then it was absolutely positioned — correct, so it can fill whatever
 *      height the row turns out to be — inside a parent with no width. An
 *      absolutely positioned child gives its parent no width, so the column
 *      collapsed to nothing and the graph drew straight over the commit
 *      subjects. Reported in three words: "encima del texto no".
 *
 * Both are visible in the markup, so they are held here rather than by looking
 * at it again. No DOM: `renderToStaticMarkup` is enough to see a style
 * attribute, and the row builders are pure.
