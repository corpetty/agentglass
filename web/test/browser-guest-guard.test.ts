/*
 * The `will-attach-webview` guard, finally under test.
 *
 * docs/BROWSER-TIER1.md asked for this when the browser shipped ("The
 * `will-attach-webview` guard: given hostile params, assert the dangerous ones
 * are stripped") and it did not exist. Nothing in the repo touched
 * `safeGuestUrl` or the guard body — web/test/browser-drive.test.ts covers the
 * verbs against a fake element, web/test/browser-profiles.test.ts covers the
 * partition NAMES, and the one function that decides whether a page the app did
 * not write may hold the app's bridge was checked by eye, in a running app,
 * once.
 *
 * Written before the Electron 33 → 43 upgrade rather than after, so "the guard
 * survived the bump" is something the suite says and not something the person
 * who did the bump says.
 *
 * The two failures it exists to catch, both silent in the worst direction:
 *   * a guest that attaches with a `preload` — it would get `window.agentglass`
 *     and with it the API token, i.e. a terminal and git write access handed to
 *     whatever page is loaded;
 *   * a guest that attaches on `persist:agentglass` — the app's OWN session,
 *     where that token's storage lives.
