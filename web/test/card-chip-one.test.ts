/*
 * ONE CHIP FOR THE TRACKER CARD, EVERYWHERE.
 *
 * `ORBIT-1042` with its priority flag in the priority's own colour — blue for
 * normal, amber for high, red for urgent, an outline flag for none. It appears
 * on the board's card, in the pull request's masthead and in the sidebar, and
 * it drifted into three different things: a chip with ClickUp's logo, a chip
 * with a flag, and a bare label with neither.
 *
 * It drifted DURING this work, which is the point. Moving the card's details
 * onto their own line took the flag off the board's chip, and the same id was
 * then drawn two ways on one screen. "CONSISTENCIA JODER" — and that is a lint,
 * not a note: one component, and nothing else allowed to draw this.
