/*
 * Which way a pull request lands, and who decides.
 *
 * The panel opened on "Squash & merge" everywhere, because a constant said so.
 * On a repository whose convention is the merge commit — where the whole team
 * presses the blue button and changes nothing — that made the default the one
 * thing nobody wanted, on the one control that cannot be undone. And it was
 * component state, so a choice made in the menu was thrown away by a trip to
 * the Files tab.
 *
 * What is pinned here is the rule, not today's wording: the repository decides
 * what is on offer, the remembered choice wins while it is still on offer, and
 * the subject that lands on the base branch reads like the method that wrote
 * it. Plus one rule over the panel itself, because the failure was a hard-coded
 * string and a comment cannot stop the next one.
