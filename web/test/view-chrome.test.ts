/*
 * One vocabulary for the controls a view puts in its own chrome.
 *
 * `ViewHeader` fixed the bar's HEIGHT, after five headers written at five
 * different times had drifted enough that switching views made the frame twitch.
 * What it did not fix is what goes IN the bar, so the drift moved one level
 * down: a chip at 11.5px in one panel, 10px in the next, and a segmented control
 * with its own border and inner padding in a third — visibly taller than the
 * chips doing the same job beside it.
 *
 * The result reads as switching applications rather than switching views, and
 * the sections of one view have to match the sections of the next.
 *
 * The canon is not a preference stated here. It is what the panels already
 * agree on, counted across the view files when this was written:
 *
 *     rounded-lg  94   ·   px-2  63   ·   py-1  54   ·   text-[11px]  51
 *
 * So this holds new work to it, and `workspace/Chrome.tsx` is where the shape
 * lives so a view does not have to remember the numbers.
