/*
 * What Refresh actually refreshes, and what it must not blank on the way.
 *
 * Reported with six screenshots: a line comment deleted on GitHub, Refresh
 * pressed in the pull request, and the comment still there — "I have to go back
 * to the PR board, open the PR again and now it is gone… but it should be
 * reactive in the PR detail too, without causing flickers or odd behaviour".
 *
 * Two defects in one sentence:
 *
 *   - The review GitHub is holding for you (its "pending review", the comments
 *     drafted in the browser) was fetched in an effect keyed on the open pull
 *     request alone. Refresh does not change which pull request is open, so
 *     that fetch never ran again — only leaving and coming back re-mounted it.
 *   - Refresh emptied the diff to make its effect run again, because "is the
 *     text empty?" WAS the has-it-been-fetched test. So the file you were
 *     reading went blank for as long as GitHub took.
 *
 * Both answer to one counter now: everything per-pull-request re-asks when it
 * changes, and nothing is cleared first — what is on screen stays until the new
 * answer replaces it.
 *
 * Source-level: this is about which dependency arrays and which guards exist,
 * and `bun test` has no React to run them in.
