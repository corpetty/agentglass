/**
 * The board is not a view of the list: it draws two fetches of its own —
 * `mine` and `review` — and never looks at `prs`. So a rule set in the builder
 * narrowed the table behind it and changed no lane at all.
 *
 * Two rules, because the failure needed both and neither can see the other:
 * what `is not` means on a card status, and that the board is handed the
 * filtered arrays — which no unit test can check, since a prop wired to the
 * wrong name still type-checks.
