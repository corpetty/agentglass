/*
 * Nothing polls from a view you are not looking at.
 *
 * Every panel in this app stays mounted when you switch away from it — that is
 * deliberate, and it is what makes coming back instant. The cost is that a
 * `setInterval` written inside one keeps running for as long as the app is
 * open, whether or not anybody is looking, whether or not the window is even on
 * screen. Measured on a cockpit parked on the Terminal: the pull request panel
 * alone was asking git about a branch nobody had open ~158,000 times a day.
 *
 * `usePoll(active, fn, ms)` is the answer this repo already had: it stops when
 * the view is not active, stops while the document is hidden, and refreshes the
 * moment the window comes back. This file is the lock that keeps the three
 * panels that were missing it from drifting back.
 *
 * Asserted against the source rather than by running the effects, because there
 * is no DOM in these suites — bun test, no jsdom — so no effect ever runs here.
 * A bare `setInterval` in one of these files is exactly the shape that was
 * wrong, so its absence is the thing worth pinning.
