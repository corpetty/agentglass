/*
 * "Can the finder search by assignee name?"
 *
 * It could not. The box matched the number, the title and the AUTHOR — which
 * answers "whose pull request is this" and never "where is Javi on this",
 * while the card under the cursor said "Waiting on javidoe" in as many
 * words. On a board of 389 open pull requests that is the question people
 * actually type into it.
 *
 * Assignees and requested reviewers both. On this board they are one question
 * wearing two hats — who owns it, and who is being waited on — and somebody
 * looking for their own name does not care which column it landed in. The
 * facets stay the exact filters they were; this is the free-text box, where a
 * partial name is the point.
 *
 * Logins, not display names: a display name is not on a list row at all, so
 * matching one would cost a fetch per row.
