/*
 * Moving the card at merge time.
 *
 * The habit being replaced: merge here, then open ClickUp and drag the card
 * out of Code Review by hand — and sometimes forget. What is pinned here is
 * the part with consequences, because a wrong answer writes to a real board:
 * the select opens where the card already is, so leaving it alone writes
 * nothing; the order offered is the board's own workflow and not the
 * alphabet; and a failed card move never reads as a failed merge.
