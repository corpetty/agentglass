/*
 * One "N unread" chip, not two switches wearing the same label.
 *
 * The board kept its own `onlyUnread` state and drew its own chip, next to the
 * panel's filter bar drawing an identical chip over its own `unreadOnly` state.
 * The two never touched each other, so pressing the filter bar's chip on the
 * Board view changed nothing on screen — it toggled a state the board never
 * read. Both chips now read and write the one state the panel owns.
 *
 * Read as source, not rendered: a missing wire is invisible in a snapshot of
 * either component alone, because each one renders correctly with whatever
 * state it was handed. The bug is in which state that is — a fact about the
 * call site, not about either component's own output.
