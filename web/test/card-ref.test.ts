// Reading the ClickUp card out of a pull request that never says it has one.
//
// The fixture is modelled on a real pull request of a team that works this way:
// a branch named for the card, a template whose checklist links a card of its
// OWN, and a reference section with the address in it. Ids and addresses here
// are invented; the SHAPE is what was measured, and every rule below exists
// because of something in it.

/*
 * A pull-request template, trimmed to the three parts that matter: a checklist
 * that links a card of its own, the real reference below it, and prose.
 *
 * The checklist line is why this file exists. Taking the first ClickUp address
 * in the body sent twelve of fourteen real pull requests to the SAME card —
 * every one that had ticked that box — and each of them looked right, because
 * the chip was labelled from the branch.
