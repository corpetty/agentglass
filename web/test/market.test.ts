/*
 * The market screen: one list, and only what you can still take.
 *
 * Both rules here were the screen's two complaints. A plugin already on the
 * machine was offered again, on a shelf of one, so the page read as if
 * nothing had been installed; and the list itself could be removed — on the
 * only list there is — leaving a plugins page whose whole content was a box
 * asking for somebody else's URL.
 *
 * The search rule is asserted against the function, the rest against the
 * source, because there is no renderer in this project.
