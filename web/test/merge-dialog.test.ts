/*
 * The warning you get for landing a pull request past a review you asked for.
 *
 * Reported from a real pull request: an automation approved it, GitHub called
 * it mergeable, and the panel said "Ready to merge — nothing is standing in the
 * way" while a named person sat in "1 pending review". Nothing was wrong about
 * the mechanics. The sentence was about branch protection and the reader was
 * asking about their colleague.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. The warning shipped with three assertions over
 * it, all of them reading MergeDialog.tsx as text: that the interface still
 * declares `awaitingReview?: string[]`, that the words "asked to review and"
 * appear somewhere in the file, and that no `disabled=` is spelled against the
 * field. Nothing rendered the dialog. An audit changed the one condition that
 * decides whether the banner is drawn —
 *
 *     {(pending.awaitingReview?.length ?? 0) > 0 && (   →   … > 99 && (
 *
 * — so the warning could never appear on any pull request anybody will ever
 * open, and the whole suite stayed green: the interface line was untouched, the
 * prose was still in the file, and prose in a branch nothing can reach is prose
 * nobody reads.
 *
 * So this renders it. There is no DOM under `bun test`, so the component goes
 * through `renderToStaticMarkup` exactly as `file-rail-view.test.ts` does, and
 * what is asserted is the sentence a person gets — singular against plural, the
 * overflow, the clause about automation, and the button still being pressable
 * underneath all of it.

/*
 * Two seams, both mocked for the same reason: they are the parts of this
 * component that need a browser, and neither is what is being asserted.
 *
 * `Portal` calls `document.createElement` in a `useState` initialiser — which
 * runs during render, not in an effect — and then `createPortal`, which React's
 * server renderer refuses outright. It exists to escape the panel's stacking
 * context; here there is no stacking context, so a passthrough is the whole
 * truth of it.
 *
 * `api.ts` reads `window.agentglass`, `location.href` and localStorage while
 * its module body runs. The dialog only calls it from an effect, and
 * `renderToStaticMarkup` runs no effects, so nothing here reaches a stub — but
 * the import alone would throw before the first test.

/*
 * The api stub DELEGATES; it does not replace the module.
 *
 * `mock.module` is keyed on a resolved path and lasts for the whole `bun test`
 * process, and this call sits at module scope — so the four functions below
 * used to BE `src/lib/api.ts` for every suite that loaded it afterwards. That
 * is not a local decision, it is a process-wide one, and it broke two suites
 * that had nothing to do with this dialog. Measured on ubuntu-latest, where
 * the file order put this file tenth and its victim thirtieth:
 * `gate-answer-took.test.ts` died with "api.gateDecide is not a function",
 * because the stub had four clickup calls and nothing else. It stayed green
 * here for the ordinary reason an order-dependent bug does — this machine
 * loads the files in a different order.
 *
 * So the real module is imported first, through a specifier `mock.module` does
 * not match, and the stub is that module with the four calls overridden. Every
 * other export — `api.gateDecide` included — is the genuine one.
 *
 * The globals go up before that import rather than after: `api.ts` reads
 * `location.href`/`location.hostname` and localStorage while its module body
 * runs, which is the throw this mock originally existed to dodge.
