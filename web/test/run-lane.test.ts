/*
 * The run lane, drawn.
 *
 * A run is one prompt asked in several checkouts at once, and the half of it
 * worth building is the ADOPTED leg: a pane the user started themselves, in a
 * checkout this app never cut, possibly running another vendor's CLI. Every
 * assertion below exists because that leg can be lost in one of three quiet
 * ways — drawn like the others, counted twice because it also sits in its
 * project group, or explained only in a tooltip nobody opens.
 *
 * There is no DOM under `bun test`, so what these render is the FIRST PAINT:
 * effects have not run and nothing has been fetched. Where a test needs the
 * per-leg numbers it seeds the store through a stubbed `fetch` first, which is
 * the same route the real panel takes and keeps the fixtures honest — they are
 * the bodies server/src/index.ts actually answers with.
