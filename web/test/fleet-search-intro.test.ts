/*
 * What the fleet search says it searches, before anything is typed.
 *
 * The empty state read "Search every event ever captured — 12k+ prompts,
 * commands and outputs." Three claims, three wrong:
 *
 *   "12k+"          a literal in the source, not a count of anything;
 *   "ever captured" the full-text rows are pruned with the events at
 *                   AGENTGLASS_RETENTION_DAYS (8 by default), so a search for
 *                   something from last month finds nothing and says so as if
 *                   it had never happened;
 *   "outputs"       a tool's output is not in the index — ftsText() in
 *                   server/src/db.ts takes the command, the path, the prompt,
 *                   the message, the agent's closing reply and the error.
 *
 * So the line is computed from the retention the server reports, and names
 * only what the index holds.
