 *   * **somebody there has to agree.** After the code there is a wait, and what
 *     it is waiting for is a person — named, with the request in front of them.
 *
 * It is deliberately the only thing on the display. A pairing handshake folded
 * into a settings pane is one people click through; this asks for two actions
