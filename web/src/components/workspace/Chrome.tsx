/*
 * The controls a view puts in its own top bar, said once.
 *
 * `ViewHeader` already fixed the bar's HEIGHT, and for exactly this reason: five
 * headers written at five different times had drifted, and switching views made
 * the frame twitch. What it never fixed is what goes IN the bar, so the drift
 * moved one level down — a chip at 11.5px here, one at 10px there, a segmented
 * control with its own border and inner padding in a third. The effect is
 * that switching views reads as switching applications.
 *
 * Nothing here is invented. The numbers are the ones the panels already agree
 * on, counted across the six view files:
 *
 *     rounded-lg   94        text-[11px]    51
 *     px-2         63        text-[10.5px]  38
 *     py-1         54        text-[10px]    22
 *
 * So the chip is `text-[11px] px-2 py-1 rounded-lg`, and everything below is
 * that one shape wearing different states. A view that needs something this
 * cannot express should add it HERE, where the next view will find it.
