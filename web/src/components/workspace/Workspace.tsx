// The shell. Not an overlay any more — the application.
//
// This was a modal: a Portal, a scrim, an AnimatePresence, and a frame inset
// from the viewport that you opened with ⌘\ and closed with Escape. That shape
// made sense when it was five separate panels being consolidated. It stopped
// making sense the day it became the thing people are inside 99% of the time:
// the app's front door was a screen nobody visited, and the thing everybody
// used was a dialog on top of it.
//
// So the frame IS the window now. No scrim, no open/close, nothing to return
// to — and the dashboard did not disappear, it moved into the rail beside every
// other view, entire and unchanged.
//
// Mounting changed with it. Every view used to mount as soon as the workspace
// opened and stay mounted for the life of the process, which is what kept a
// half-written commit message alive while you looked at the diff. That is still
// true of a view you have BEEN to; what changed is that a view you have never
// opened does not exist yet. On a fresh window that is one view rather than
// eight, and the dashboard — fourteen panels and a poll every four seconds — is
// not among them until you ask for it.
