// What the notch used to say, in the bar that replaced it.
//
// The shell rethink built TopBar and gave it the notch's clock, its plan meters
// and its live counts. The rest stayed behind in DynamicIsland — and nothing
// mounted DynamicIsland any more, so it went quiet without anything reporting a
// fault. The stores never noticed either: sysNotify.ts opens its socket on the
// preference alone, so every mirrored desktop notification since then landed in
// a history with no window onto it, and Settings went on offering to configure a
// feature that no longer had a surface.
//
// So this is that surface, in two halves, because they answer two questions:
//
//   the LANE — one toast in the middle of the bar — answers "what just
//   happened", for the moment you look up from your work.
//
//   the BELL — a count, and the list behind it — answers "what did I miss",
//   whenever you choose to ask. Everything the lane shows is in the list too, so
//   a toast you never saw costs you nothing.
//
// A third half, since: your machine's own notifications no longer pass through
// the lane at all. They are cards now (NoteToasts.tsx), because a Slack message
// is prose and this lane is a caption. They still land in the bell, which is why
// the empty state below is the place that offers to switch them on.
//
// Both live in the strip rather than in a view, deliberately. The complaint this
// came out of was being pulled away from the terminal to find out what wanted
// you; a surface welded to the top of the window is one you can read without
// going anywhere.
