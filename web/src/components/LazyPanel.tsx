/*
 * A view that arrives in its own chunk, and what happens when it does not.
 *
 * Code-splitting a panel is only free if the fetch always succeeds, and here it
 * does not always succeed: the bundle is served over HTTP by the sidecar, and
 * the LAN and Tailscale companions load the same one over a link that drops.
 * A bare `<Suspense>` around a lazy import turns that into a spinner that never
 * ends — a view permanently replaced by a loading state, with no way back short
 * of reloading the whole app.
 *
 * So the boundary is part of the split, not an extra. It says what happened and
 * offers the retry, which is the only action there is: the chunk is one request
 * away and the reason it failed is usually already over.
