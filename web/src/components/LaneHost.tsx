/**
 * The whole page of a lane host: one webview and the browser ask handler.
 *
 * Asks go straight to `serveBrowserAsk`, the same path the Browser panel's
 * handler ends in, so every verb runs through the unchanged driver. What the
 * panel adds on top — tabs, containers, the cross-container refusal — is not
 * here: one webview, in the container the lane was made for (`profile`: the
 * person's own, a named one, or one that is this lane's alone). The tab verbs
 * see exactly one tab, so `open` lands in it, and an ask naming any other tab
 * is refused rather than served from this one.
 *
 * `ephemeral` (S6, `lane new --from-template`): an in-memory jar of its own,
 * checked before `profile` so a lane with no profile string still never falls
 * through to `partitionFor`'s empty-string case, which is the person's own
 * cookies. Its partition string is built again here rather than imported: it
 * is CommonJS in electron/guest-guard.js (`ephemeralPartition`), which this
 * renderer bundle cannot require() — the same reason `shared/csp.ts`'s list
 * is a documented copy in main.js rather than an import. Keep the two in
 * sync by hand if the shape in guest-guard.js's `EPHEMERAL_PARTITION_RE` ever
 * changes.
