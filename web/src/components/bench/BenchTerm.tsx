/*
 * One tab of the bench, as a terminal.
 *
 * Every tab that runs something is this: a shell, an agent CLI, an editor on a
 * file. What changes is what the tmux session was told to run — the server
 * decides that from the query (see engineBenchArgv), and from here it is one
 * socket and one xterm either way.
 *
 * The tab is bound to a SESSION, not to this socket. Closing the window
 * disconnects; the session keeps running on the engine and the next connection
 * with the same slot reattaches to it. That is the whole promise of the bench,
 * and it is why this component is allowed to be as small as it is: persistence
 * is tmux's job, not React's.
