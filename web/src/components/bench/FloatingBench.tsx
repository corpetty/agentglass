/*
 * The bench: a window that floats over whatever view you are in.
 *
 * The problem it answers is the same one the file palette answers, one floor
 * up. A shell, the file you were reading, a note, an agent — each of those
 * lives in a VIEW, so reaching one costs leaving the diff or the pull request
 * you were reading, and the trip back is the expensive part. This does not take
 * the screen from anything: it opens on top, nothing underneath moves, and it
 * goes away with the same chord.
 *
 * What makes it more than a panel is underneath: every tab that runs something
 * is its own tmux session on the engine (see engineBenchArgv). Close the
 * window, close the app, come back tomorrow — the tab reattaches to the session
 * still running whatever it was running. A floating terminal that dies with its
 * window would be a worse terminal than the one in the Terminal view; this one
 * is the same terminal, in a place you can reach from anywhere.
 *
 * Three decisions are written into the shape of this file, and each was made
 * once so it does not have to be made again:
 *
 *   ONE window, with tabs. Several floating windows is a desktop to tidy, and
 *   there is one of those already.
 *
 *   The tabs belong to a CHECKOUT. Moving the chip does not close anything: the
 *   other set is still on the engine, and the menu says so.
 *
 *   The button is loose. It is dragged where you want it and remembered as a
 *   proportion of the window, never as pixels — this machine has two monitors
 *   at different scales.

   * window and every tab in it were built again, each terminal reattached and
   * repainted, and the board — rendered once by the workspace, see boardHost.ts
   * — was carried back to its view on close and into the window again on open,
   * which re-styles and re-lays-out its whole tree both ways. Kept, the board
   * stays in the window and an open is a repaint. The one case that still
   * moves it is standing on that board's own view: closed, the window gives it
   * back to the view on screen, which is the point of the view.
   *
   * The ceiling this buys: a closed bench keeps what its visited tabs run —
   * each terminal's socket and client, a board's element — for as long as the
   * app is open, exactly as a hidden tab of an open bench always has. And a
   * menu a tab had open when the chord closed the window is not closed with
   * it: only the window's own two are.
   *
   * Hidden is opacity for the paint, the window put under the app once the
   * fade is over so clicks reach the view (UNDER_THE_APP), `aria-hidden` for
   * a screen reader, and the focus kept out (below). What is inside stays laid
   * out, the same as a view behind the rail that is not on screen.

   * word and each is inherited — Chromium carries `inert` as a style too — so
   * flipping any of them on the root re-styles every node in the window:
   * measured at 100 to 160 ms of style recalculation per open on an idle
   * machine, on seven thousand elements, with a card's activity showing. A
   * z-index is not inherited. NOT `content-visibility: hidden` or a clip to
   * nothing either: the lists here skip off-screen rows with
   * `content-visibility: auto`, and a window hidden either way has none on
   * screen — they came back a frame after the window did, an empty list in the
   * first frames of the fade, and waiting those frames out cost more than the
