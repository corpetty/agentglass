/*
 * The market: the one list of plugins this project publishes.
 *
 * What was here before was a collection of *catalogues*. A catalogue was a
 * URL somebody added, it arrived collapsed behind its own address, and the
 * list it held opened only after a click on that address — so the first
 * thing the screen said about plugins was a JSON URL with a Remove button
 * next to it, and the plugins themselves were two clicks behind it. Removing
 * that row, on the only list there is, left a settings page whose entire
 * plugin story was "Add by URL…".
 *
 * So: one list, named, read on sight and not addable or removable. Adding a
 * stranger's list is a distribution model this project does not have, and a
 * button that offers one is a promise the app does not keep. Publishing a
 * plugin is opening a pull request against the list — see docs/PLUGINS.md —
 * and the URL below is where that list ends up.
 *
 * It is still fetched fresh every time and never cached: the document is on
 * GitHub Pages, and a stale shelf read as live is the one thing this must
 * not do.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE: an installed plugin. The market is what you can take,
 * and a card offering to install what is on the shelf already was the thing
 * that made this page unreadable with one plugin published. They are counted
 * in a line under the grid rather than dropped silently, so a market that
 * looks empty says why.

/**
 * The sentence the install acts on: a name in a list is not what lands on the
 * disk, the repository at a ref is.
 *
 * A commit is printed short, as git prints one, with all forty characters in
 * the title — the short form is what a person compares against a repository
 * page, and the full one is there for the person who wants to be sure. It is
 * the only kind of ref that names bytes; a branch or a tag is a pointer its
 * author can move, and the line under it says which of the two this is. When
 * the entry also carries a content hash, the install refuses a tree that does
 * not match it, and that is said too — only then, because a promise the
 * server does not keep is worse than none.
 *
 * Exported for the test, which renders it: there is no renderer in this
 * project, and the dialog it sits in is a portal that draws nothing without
 * a document.
