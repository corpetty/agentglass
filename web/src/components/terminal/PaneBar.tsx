/*
 * One bar per pane, hidden under the pane's own bottom edge.
 *
 * What came before this was a 2×2 block of icon-only doors in the pane's
 * bottom-right corner. It worked, and it said nothing: four glyphs cannot name
 * WHICH pull request or WHICH card they open, and a pane in a fleet of six is
 * exactly where that question gets asked. Everything tried to fix it inside the
 * block — a line under the icons, a label on hover, a panel above it — made the
 * corner of a terminal into a paragraph, and he said so: "what a shitty piece of
 * UI this is".
 *
 * So the block is gone and the bar is the whole thing: "we no longer need the
 * drawer, only the bar". It is the strip that used to sit above the terminal —
 * worktree badge, branch, copy, changed count, pull request, card — except that
 * it belongs to ONE pane, is drawn on that pane, and is not there until you ask
 * for it.
 *
 * The asking is a hover, and the affordance is a seam: a 4px line across the
 * pane's foot, tinted by the four things behind it, which is his own idea and
 * the reason it is not a chevron — "es sencillo y claro". Point at the seam and
 * the bar rises out of the edge; take the pointer away and it drops back, after
 * a grace period, because leaving by accident must not cost you the bar.
 *
 * Two rules the previous attempt broke:
 *
 *   - The pane NEVER moves. The bar floats over the shell; nothing is resized,
 *     nothing reflows, no row of output is lost to it.
 *   - Nothing is stolen at rest. The seam is `pointer-events: none` — the
 *     terminal's own bottom rows keep every click and every drag. The pointer
 *     is watched by the pane slot, which is already watching it for tmux.
 */

/** The visible line, and how far above the pane's edge the pointer counts as
 *  "on it". The zone is deliberately taller than the line: this is a target you
 *  should hit without aiming.
 *
 *  3px, flush with the pane's last pixel row. At 4px with a 3px gap it was
 *  drawn straight through the descenders of the bottom line — "can you put it
 *  a bit lower so it doesn't sit on top of the text?", with a screenshot of the line
 *  it was crossing. A terminal's last row goes all the way to the edge, so the
 *  only place a line does not cover a letter is under the baseline of the last
