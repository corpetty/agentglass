 * Adding a phone, from the machine's side.
 *
 * This replaced a QR code that *was* the credential. Scanning it handed over
 * `AGENTGLASS_TOKEN` — the machine's own secret, with no expiry, no identity
 * and no way to take it back from one device — which meant a photograph of
 * this pane, a screenshot in a chat or a shared window in a call was a working
 * key to a terminal. There was no way to scan it carefully; being able to see
 * it was the whole authorisation.
 *
 * The QR now carries an invitation, and an invitation is worth nothing on its
 * own. Between it and a credential are the two steps this panel exists to
 * make visible:
 *
 *   * **six digits that are only on this screen.** They are not in the QR, so
 *     scanning it from a picture gets you a form asking for something the
 *     picture does not contain.
 *   * **a person here saying yes.** The request arrives named, with the
 *     address it came from and the same code, and waits.
 *
 * The full protocol, and what it does and does not defend against, is in
 * server/src/pairing.ts.
