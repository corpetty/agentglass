/*
 * The git view's visual system.
 *
 * The CONTROLS in it are not its own: `CHIP` comes from `workspace/Chrome.tsx`,
 * which is where the app's one button shape lives. This file used to declare two
 * more of them — a 10.5px rounded-lg and a 10px rounded-full — so the git view's
 * buttons were a different size from the identical buttons one view away. What
 * stays local is what is genuinely this view's: the row with its status rail,
 * the group heading, the empty state.
 *
 * The first pass at this unified the plumbing — one grid, one set of type
 * sizes, one chip — and the verdict on it was that it still looked like the
 * same list, which was fair: a tidy table of 10px text is still a table of 10px
 * text. The row was the problem, not its tracks.
 *
 * So the row is not a table line any more. It is an object with a hierarchy:
 *
 *     ┃  feat/consolidate-work            gone  ↑166        [ Delete ]
 *     ┃  5 min ago · c76e387 · worktree -consolidate
 *
 *   * a 3px STATUS RAIL down the left, coloured by what the row's state is —
 *     the thing you scan a list of thirty branches for, findable without
 *     reading a word;
 *   * the NAME at 13px, the size the eye lands on first, and the only string
 *     on the row at that size;
 *   * everything else demoted to a 10px SECOND LINE of dot-separated facts,
 *     where dates and shas and paths stop competing with the name;
 *   * air: 12px of vertical padding and 6px between rows, against the 26px
 *     table rows this replaces;
 *   * one action, which appears on hover in a lane reserved for it, so it can
 *     never sit on top of anything.
 *
 * Nothing here invents a colour: every value is a token the app already
 * defines. What changed is how much of each one there is.
