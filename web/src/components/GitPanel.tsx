                      The second is the one its neighbours already solved and
                      it never got: it said nothing while it worked and nothing

                      several seconds of nothing reads as "the button is
                      broken" — and on a fast repo the honest problem is the
                      opposite, that a refresh which changes nothing visible is
                      indistinguishable from one that never ran. So it spins
