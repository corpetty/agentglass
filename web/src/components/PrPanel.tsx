// Pull requests, so a review does not mean opening a browser.
//
// What shapes this panel, all of it learned from real pull requests rather than
// guessed:
//
// 1. The conversation is mostly machines. On a live review, four issue comments
//    were all from CI and one coverage table alone was 46,551 characters, while
//    the single human review that blocked the merge sat last. So it reads in
//    three lanes — humans, line threads, automation — and the machine lane
//    collapses to its digest.
//
// 2. A body is markdown, and prose set to the full width of a 2000px window is
//    unreadable however correct the formatting. Everything written by a person
//    renders through `Md`, which holds a reading measure and centres it.
//
// 3. Diffs are not re-implemented. `SplitDiff`/`UnifiedDiff` from ChangesModal
//    are the app's diff viewer, keybindings and all; a pull request is
//    translated into the `FileChange` they already speak.
//
// 4. Nothing waits on the network. `gh` costs a second or more per call and the
//    server has one thread; every read is a cached answer with its age shown.

   * `checksStanding` is where "an empty rollup is not a green one" lives: a
   * head commit that moved a second ago has no runs yet and looks exactly like
   * a repository that runs none, and only the caller knows which. Deciding it
   * again here would be a second opinion on a question that already has an
   * answer, and the header and the Overview box would drift apart the first
   * time either was touched — which is the bug mergeReason.ts was written for.
   *
   * The sentence is the helpers' too, for the same reason: the strip and the
   * box say the same words about the same rollup. `checksLine` covers green
   * and still-running and answers null on the two it deliberately will not
   * speak for — nothing red, and nothing at all.
   *
   * Red is `mergeBlockedWhy`, asked as "UNSTABLE" rather than as this pull
   * request's merge state: the cell is keyed CHECKS, so a conflict with the
   * base is not its answer to give, and UNSTABLE is the state that means "ask
   * the rollup". It names the check, which is the whole point of that helper —
   * a bare count is what sends people to the browser to find out which one.

   * "2 checks passed, 3 checks still running". Both are true and only one fits
   * on a row of nine cells — the sentence belongs in Overview, where there is a
   * paragraph to put it in. Red still names the failing check, because a name
   * is the thing that stops you opening the browser, and the mockup's sample
