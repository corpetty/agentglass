/*
 * A FILTER YOU BUILD, rather than a row of chips somebody chose for you.
 *
 * The chips along the top of the board are the tags the loaded cards happen to
 * carry, plus `mine`, plus a status picker. That answers "show me the cards
 * tagged X" and cannot answer "show me the cards of one squad", which is what
 * was asked for — a squad is a CUSTOM FIELD, so it had a column and no chip:
 * the board could say which squad every card belonged to and could not show
 * you one squad's.
 *
 * The general shape is the tracker's own, and it is the right one:
 *
 *     Where  [Status]  [is]      [READY FOR ENGINEERING]
 *     AND    [Squad]   [is not]  [Crimson, Olive]
 *
 * One join for the whole set rather than per row, which is also what the
 * tracker does. Nested groups are the next thing after that and are not here:
 * everything anybody has actually asked for is one flat list, and a builder
 * that can express `(a OR b) AND (c OR d)` before anybody needs it is a lot of
 * screen to look past.
 *
 * FIELDS ARE DISCOVERED, never listed. Which fields exist depends on the
 * board — a workspace's custom fields are its own — so they are derived from
 * the cards that are loaded, and a board with no squad field simply has no
 * squad row to offer. The alternative is a menu naming fields this board does
 * not have.
