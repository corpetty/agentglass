// Your machine's notifications, on top of the app that is covering your screen.
//
// The whole reason the mirror exists is that agentglass runs fullscreen: a Slack
// ping fires a banner you never see, because this app is what is in front of it.
// The server has read those off the D-Bus session bus for a while and the bell
// has listed them — but the only thing that *interrupted* was a line of 10px
// text in the middle of the top bar, which loses its slot to the "needs you"
// chip the moment anything is held, and which cannot carry a message anyway.
// "Slack — New message from Alejandro García" is two lines of prose, not a
// caption.
//
// So mirrored notifications get the surface they always needed: a card, in a
// stack, over everything. Deliberately separate from the bar's lane, which keeps
// agentglass's own passing events — those are captions ("Turn finished", "3 to
// pull") and belong in a caption-sized place.
//
// What it is not: a notification daemon. Your desktop still shows its own
// banners exactly as before; this is a copy for the case where you cannot see
// them. And nothing arrives here unless the feature is switched on, because the
// socket that feeds it is not opened until then (see sysNotify.ts).
