// Says out loud what the UI is talking to, when what it is talking to is wrong.
//
// The dashboard's API origin is configured three ways and guessed a fourth:
// `VITE_CW_SERVER`, the origin the desktop shell verified and handed over, the
// server having served the page itself — and, failing all three,
// `http://<host>:4000`. That last one is a guess, and nothing used to check it.
//
// When the guess is wrong the app does not fail, which is the problem. Requests
// go to whoever owns the port, come back as 404s or shapes we do not
// understand, and the cockpit renders exactly as it would with no agents: empty
// panels, "no repos found", no error anywhere. The honest reading of that
// screen is "this project is broken".
//
// TWO SOURCES, because the origin being CONFIGURED never meant it was ALIVE.
// This file used to stop at the first line of its effect — `if (!SERVER_GUESSED)
// return` — on the grounds that the desktop shell probes the port. It does, and
// that is a different claim: the shell probes to PICK a port and then spawns a
// sidecar into it. When that spawn failed there was no server, no banner (the
// guard above is false in the packaged app, always, because api.ts sets
// SERVER_GUESSED from DESKTOP_API), and nothing on screen but a CLOSED pill in
// the header. So the shell now reports its own failures and they are rendered
// here, with the reason and the fix, beside the guess-check that came first.
