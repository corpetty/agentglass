 * Keep a terminal's colours in step with the app's theme, while it's open.

 * created and when the panel was reopened, so switching theme with the terminal
 * on screen left it painted in the old palette. The visible symptom is a strip
 * down the right where the container (which follows `var(--bg)` live) no longer
 * matches the terminal's own background — which reads as a layout bug rather
 * than a stale colour.
 *
 * Watched at the root element, because that's where the theme toggle writes:
 * both the `data-theme` attribute and the inline custom properties land there.

                      out of the terminal, so a phone connecting reflowed every
                      pane on the desk and disconnecting reflowed them back:
                      the notice about a resize was itself causing one, and a
                      full-screen TUI redrew underneath it both times. Floating,
                      it costs the terminal no rows at all and nothing moves.

                      Anchored inside the pane box rather than to the viewport,
                      which puts it in the screen's bottom right corner without
                      covering the status line, and, because the whole terminal

                      another view, means it cannot follow you into chat or the
                      diff the way a portal to the body would.

                      Deliberately OUTSIDE the `!tmuxBar` guard above: this is
                      not the tab strip, and someone who kept tmux's own status
                      line has exactly the same broken layout and none of the
                      strip.

                      events stop at the card itself, so a drag that starts

                            is a consequence of the server putting these back by

                            a marked window with nobody on it is restored within
                            a couple of seconds without anybody clicking. So by
                            the time this sentence is on screen the size is one
                            this app cannot prove it took — most often somebody's

                            The zoom sentence has one state, because it is only
                            ever shown while a phone is here (see
