                      out of the terminal, so a phone connecting reflowed every
                      pane on the desk and disconnecting reflowed them back:
                      the notice about a resize was itself causing one, and a
                      full-screen TUI redrew underneath it both times. Floating,
                      it costs the terminal no rows at all and nothing moves.

                      Anchored inside the pane box rather than to the viewport,
                      which puts it in the screen's bottom right corner without

                      another view, means it cannot follow you into chat or the
                      diff the way a portal to the body would.

                      Deliberately OUTSIDE the `!tmuxBar` guard above: this is
                      not the tab strip, and someone who kept tmux's own status
                      line has exactly the same broken layout and none of the
                      strip.

                      events stop at the card itself, so a drag that starts

                            a marked window with nobody on it is restored within
                            a couple of seconds without anybody clicking. So by

                            this app cannot prove it took — most often somebody's

                            The zoom sentence has one state, because it is only
