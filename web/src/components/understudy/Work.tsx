/*
 * The work loop, on screen.
 *
 * Everything else in this panel was built around a different question. The
 * scorecard measures whether the understudy DECIDES like him; the queue shows
 * what it would ask for and waits. Both are instruments, and his answer to what
 * they added up to was that he still could not leave it working on his issues
 * for a day. That is what this tab is for.
 *
 * IT EXISTED ONLY OVER HTTP UNTIL NOW. The loop, the queue he fills by hand,
 * which project is open, the runs it has done — all of it was reachable with
 * curl and invisible in the application, which meant the only person who could
 * work the feature was the one holding the routes in their head. A capability
 * nobody can see is a capability nobody uses.
 *
 * THE THREE THINGS THIS SCREEN HAS TO MAKE PLAIN, because each of them is a
 * promise the loop makes and a person cannot verify from a transcript:
 *
 *   WHERE it may work — the open project, and the checkouts inside it. The
 *     fence is a setting rather than a constant, so it has to be legible.
 *   WHAT IT LEFT BEHIND — every run cuts a disposable worktree, and a failed
 *     one is kept on disk because it is the evidence. A path nobody can see is
 *     a directory nobody will ever clean up or read.
 *   WHAT THE TESTS SAID — not what the agent claimed. The two are printed as
 *     different things on purpose.
 *
 * Nothing here pushes. There is no button for it and the loop has no verb for
 * it; this repository has a great deal of local work that has never gone to a
 * remote and that decision is not the machine's to make.

 * of overwhelming info, and you don't want to touch anything in case it breaks". He
 * commissioned this feature; if it does not tell him where to start, it tells
 * nobody.
 *
 * The three tabs are three real, separate jobs, and they read left to right in
 * the REVERSE of the order they are used in: you teach it, then you check its
 * judgement, then you hand it work. `Its work` is the tab that opens, so a
 * first visit lands on the last step — a screen full of live controls attached
 * to a machine that has been taught nothing.
 *
 * So the panel says which step you are on, in one line, with one button. It is
 * not a wizard and it hides nothing: the whole panel is underneath it the
 * entire time, and the line disappears for good once a run has finished.
 *
 * The numbers are a real dependency rather than decoration, which is the only
 * thing that earns them: it cannot answer from precedents it has not read, and
 * handing work to something whose judgement you have not checked is precisely
 * the "I do not want to touch anything" this exists to answer.
