/*
 * Teaching it about you — the screen somebody meets on the day they install.
 *
 * The whole feature rests on a claim: most of what it would take to predict a
 * person is already on their machine. This is where that claim is made
 * concrete, source by source, with the counts in front of them.
 *
 * THREE RULES SHAPE THIS SCREEN.
 *
 * Consent is per source and defaults to no. These paths are not alike — one is
 * a page of conventions somebody wrote on purpose, another is two gigabytes of
 * everything they have said to a machine for a year, most of it about an
 * employer's private work. One checkbox over both would be the worst mistake
 * this feature could make.
 *
 * Nothing is read until a button is pressed. Listing shows names, counts and
 * sizes and opens no file, so a person can look at the whole inventory, change
 * their mind twice, and never have had anything read.
 *
 * The exclusion list comes FIRST, above the sources, because it is the only
 * control here that can prevent something rather than undo it.

          project rather than one switch, because each project is filed separately — and which side of that line a
          project sits on decides where its rows may ever be used, not whether they may be read.
