/*
 * The Diff view, rebuilt.
 *
 * What it is for: reading what has changed across every checkout on this
 * machine, one file at a time. What went wrong with the last one is worth
 * writing down, because most of the decisions here are a reaction to it.
 *
 * It listed rows that were really `FileChange` events — an agent's Edit call —
 * so every field a changed file needs was invented: the time became the time of
 * the request, the section name became the literal string "unstaged", and a
 * row's identity changed when you ran `git add`, which threw away the selection
 * and the review tick mid-read. It carried the full diff of 400 files to render
 * one, at 1.1 MB every four seconds. And it put a filter box and eleven 9.5px
 * chips — two rows of them — above the first file name, all of them the same
 * weight, so the control that decides WHAT THE LIST IS looked exactly like the
 * one that decides how it is sorted.
 *
 * So the shape here is: one decision in the header, sections that are the unit
 * of work (a checkout, headed by its branch), and a row that answers what
 * changed, when, and by how much. Everything else — grouping, folding, the
 * hidden counts — lives in one menu, because those are questions you ask
 * occasionally and the file list is the thing you came for.
