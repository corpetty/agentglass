/**
 * The diff renderer: unified and side-by-side, over a list of hunks.
 *
 * It lives in its own file because three panels draw diffs — the working-tree
 * changes modal, the git panel and the pull-request review — and only two of
 * them own a `FileChange`. Anything that already parsed a unified diff into
 * hunks had to invent a `FileChange` around them just to get them painted, so
 * both components take `hunks` directly and treat `c` as the convenience case.
 *
 * Everything here is presentation. It never fetches, never decides which file
 * is selected, and never asks who is looking. The row builders are pure and
 * exported on purpose: a gutter that counts wrong is cheap to pin in a unit
 * test and nearly invisible in a 400-row diff, which is exactly how the
 * "\ No newline at end of file" off-by-one survived as long as it did.
