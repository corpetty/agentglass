// GitHub issues, and somewhere to work on one.

// The list and the detail are the pull-request panel with a different query
// behind them, which is why this is short. What is new is the button: an issue
// here is not something to read, it is something to start — and, just as
// importantly, something to FINISH.
//
// Starting cuts a worktree named after the issue and puts an agent in a tmux
// window in it, which is the gesture this app's own review flow already uses.
// Finishing removes the worktree, deletes the branch and kills the window. The
// second half is the half nobody builds, and it is the reason a machine ends up
// with fourteen checkouts nobody can name.
