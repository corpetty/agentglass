// GitHub issues, and somewhere to work on one.
//
// The list and the detail are the pull-request panel with a different query
// behind them, which is why this is short. What is new is the button: an issue
// here is not something to read, it is something to start — and, just as
// importantly, something to FINISH.
//
// Starting cuts a worktree named after the issue and puts an agent in a tmux
// window in it, which is the gesture this app's own review flow already uses.
// Finishing removes the worktree, deletes the branch and kills the window. The
// second half is the half nobody builds, and it is the reason a machine ends up
// with fourteen checkouts nobody can name.

 * What a list is for, as ClickUp's own dialog is: over the board, not above it.

 * `include_markdown_description`: ClickUp's rich chips (a Google Doc, a Figma
 * file, a Slack channel) are blocks it renders in the browser and does not
 * publish, so they arrive as their labels with nothing behind them. What DOES
 * arrive is every plain URL, the branch name and the card ids, and those are
 * the ones worth wiring: a pull request opens in this app's own pull-request
 * view rather than in a browser, a card id opens the card, and a branch offers
 * to take you to it in Git.

 * than a guessed one — the last invented address in this file answered "This
 * page is unavailable", which reads as a permission problem rather than as our
