// Find a file from wherever you are.
//
// Files is a view, so reaching it costs leaving whatever you were doing —
// usually a terminal, which is precisely where you were when you needed the
// path. The trip back is the expensive part: the view keeps its state, but you
// do not keep your place.
//
// So this has no place in the layout at all. It opens over everything, centred,
// on a chord; nothing beneath it moves, which is the one property a side panel
// cannot have — a drawer that pushes reflows tmux, and a drawer that covers
// covers the terminal you were about to paste into.
//
// Three tabs rather than one box that guesses: "where is the file called X",
// "where does the code say X" and "what was I just reading" are three different
// questions with three different answers, and a single field would have to pick
// one of them for you.
//
// Opening a result raises the viewer that already exists — markdown, the editor
// toggle, the reading width — and this stays on top of it, so the next result
// is one keystroke away rather than another search.

 *
 * Two lines per row, not two things fighting for one. A worktree's branch name
