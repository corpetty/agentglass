// Find a file from wherever you are.
//
// Files is a view, so reaching it costs leaving whatever you were doing —
// usually a terminal, which is precisely where you were when you needed the
// path. The trip back is the expensive part: the view keeps its state, but you
// do not keep your place.
//
// So this has no place in the layout at all. It opens over everything, centred,
// on a chord; nothing beneath it moves, which is the one property a side panel
// cannot have — a drawer that pushes reflows tmux, and a drawer that covers
// covers the terminal you were about to paste into.
//
// Three tabs rather than one box that guesses: "where is the file called X",
// "where does the code say X" and "what was I just reading" are three different
// questions with three different answers, and a single field would have to pick
// one of them for you.
//
// Opening a result raises the viewer that already exists — markdown, the editor
// toggle, the reading width — and this stays on top of it, so the next result
// is one keystroke away rather than another search.

 * don't really understand either".
 *
 * It does not divide because worktrees of one repository SHARE the object
 * store: `origin/master` is the same answer whichever of them you ask. The only
 * thing a particular checkout can answer that the others cannot is what is on
 * ITS disk right now, uncommitted work included. So there is one list, and

 *
 *   working copies   a folder, with what it currently holds — and your edits
 *   branches         a version, read without checking anything out
 *
 * Picking a working copy also decides the repository, which is why the branch
 * list below is the one belonging to it.
