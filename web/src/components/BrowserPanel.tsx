// Pages, inside the app.
//
// These are Electron `<webview>`s rather than the newer `WebContentsView`, and
// the reason is this app's layout rather than a preference. A WebContentsView is
// a main-process rectangle positioned in *window* coordinates: it floats over
// the DOM. The workspace is a rounded overlay whose views all stay mounted and
// merely flip visibility, so a WebContentsView would sit on top of the frame,
// cover every menu and dialog the app opens, and need its bounds recomputed by
// hand on every resize and every view switch. A `<webview>` is a DOM element —
// it lays out, clips and hides like anything else, and the existing model just
// works.
//
// The guests are given nothing: no preload, no Node, their own session. That is
// enforced in the main process (`guardWebviews`), not here — attributes in this
// markup are a request, and `will-attach-webview` is the answer.
//
// EVERY tab stays mounted and only the active one is visible. Same rule as the
// workspace's views and for the same reason: a page unmounted when you look
// away is a page that reloads when you come back, losing its scroll, its form,
// and whatever an agent was doing on it. `visibility`, never `display:none` —
// a display:none ancestor measures 0x0, and a guest resized to nothing comes
// back reflowed to a single column.
