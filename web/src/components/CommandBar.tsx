// The project-commands control, shared by both terminals.
//
// There are two shells in this app — the terminal view and the console docked
// under Docker's logs — and they were not equals. The full view had a repo
// picker and a searchable list of every Makefile target and package script;
// the console, which is where migrations and container shells actually get
// run, had nothing but a prompt. Same shell, same PTY, same session store,
// half the affordances, because the controls were written inline in one panel's
// JSX and could not be reached from the other.
//
// So the control lives here now and both mount the same one. The row it draws
// is: the commands dropdown, then whatever the user has pinned.
//
// Pins are what make this more than a menu. A menu of 316 commands answers
// "what can I run"; a pinned chip answers "run the thing I run twenty times a
// day", which for a Django project is one migrate and one shell. Five is the
// cap — enough for a day's work, few enough that the row can never grow into
// the second scrolling strip this was meant to replace.
