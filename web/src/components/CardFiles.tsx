// The files on a card, and a way to actually look at them.
//
// On the board this was built for, a bug card carries fifteen screenshots — which is
// the evidence, and the one thing the panel could not show at all. The reason it is a
// tab rather than a strip at the bottom of the card is arithmetic: the metadata rides
// on the payload the card already fetches, so knowing there are fifteen is free, while
// the images behind them are half a megabyte each. Nothing is fetched until the tab is
// opened; then the browser fetches THUMBNAILS (a few kilobytes), lazily, as they come
// into view; the full image is fetched once, when it is opened in the viewer.
//
// The viewer is the point. A grid of 150px screenshots is a grid of grey rectangles —
// what a screenshot is FOR is being read.
