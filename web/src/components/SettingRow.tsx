/* ─────────────────────────── Searching the settings ─────────────────────────
 *
 * The box in the nav used to filter the PAGES. That answers "which page is
 * this on", which is the question you have when you already know the setting
 * exists — and it is the smaller half of what people type into a settings
 * search. The other half is "where is the thing that stops the beeping", and
 * for that the useful unit is the row, not the page.
 *
 * VS Code's settings search is the shape everyone recognises, and the reason
 * it works is that the result is a list of SETTINGS you can operate in place,
 * not a list of places to go and look. So: the nav still narrows to the pages
 * that match, and inside the page the rows that do not match step aside.
 *
 * Two rules keep it from lying:
 *   - if nothing on the page matches by row, the page shows in full. It got
 *     here on its keywords, and hiding every row would read as an empty page
 *     rather than as a search that went wide.
 *   - a banner says filtering is on. A page silently missing half its rows is
 *     how somebody concludes a setting was removed.
 *
 * Considered and dropped: landing on the matching row instead of hiding the
 * rest — scroll to it, mark it, leave its neighbours standing. It teaches
 * more on a first visit, but it loses the one thing hiding is good for: on a
 * page with forty rows, "is it here at all" answered by a glance rather than
 * a scan. This app's settings pages run that long — Notifications, Rail,
 * Shortcuts — and a search that exists to answer that question fast is
 * worth more here than one that also teaches geography. The banner already
 * names the page, so a second search for the same thing is a click away,
 * not a re-read of the whole list.
