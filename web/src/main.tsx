/*
 * There is one application now.
 *
 * This used to be a fork — `phoneLayoutNow()` off viewport width, pointer type,
 * a saved override and a server-planted "you are remote" flag, choosing between
 * the cockpit and a companion built for a phone. The companion is gone and the
 * native app replaced it, so every browser that reaches this file gets the
 * cockpit: a narrow laptop window, a tablet, and a phone that opens the QR link
 * alike.
 *
 * Worth saying plainly, because the fork was a capability gate and not only a
 * layout one: a device that pairs over the network now lands on the terminal,
 * git write access and docker control instead of a read-mostly queue. That is
 * not a hole this file was plugging — the token's scope is enforced by the
 * server per request (see DeviceScope), and a UI that hid the buttons never
 * stopped anything. The reason the companion existed at all is the reason it
 * could not stay: `crypto.subtle` is secure-context only, so the pairing
 * handshake is impossible over `http://192.168.x.x` and the one device the
 * companion was for could never complete it.
