/*
 * Who is reviewing this, and how it went.
 *
 * The sidebar used to print GitHub's OUTSTANDING request list — the people who
 * have been asked and have not answered — under the heading "Reviewers". On a
 * pull request where everybody has answered, that list is empty, so the panel
 * said "No reviewers" about a pull request with two approvals and one request
 * for changes on it. Reported with both screens side by side: "on GH they show
 * up as reviewers… but in agentglass as participants, with no state or
 * anything".
 *
 * GitHub's own list is the union: everybody who has reviewed, with their latest
 * verdict, plus everybody still being waited on. That is what this builds.
 *
 * Pure, and given the two arrays rather than the detail object, because every
 * awkward case here is about ORDER — three reviews from the same person, a
 * comment after an approval, a re-request after a verdict — and those are worth
 * checking without a network.
