 * the same `ChatMsg` / `ChatTool` shapes, which is what lets the panel render
 * any of them without knowing. What it changes is the endpoint, the model list,
 * and what the mode dropdown even means, so it is settled when the chat is
 * opened rather than switchable mid-thread: a resume id belongs to the CLI that
 * minted it, and there is no such thing as handing a thread from one to
 * another.
