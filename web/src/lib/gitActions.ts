// What you can do to a branch, a tag, a stash, a worktree — and which one of
// those you were probably going to do.
//
// The git view used to answer this by putting every action on the row: seven
// buttons on a branch, three on a tag, and 86 across the panel. They appeared
// on hover, which kept them out of the way of the eye but not out of the way of
// the pointer — the row you wanted to READ was the row that sprouted a toolbar,
// and the button you wanted was in a different position on every row because it
// depended on the branch's state.
//
// So the actions moved off the row and into three places that scale, and this
// file is the single list all three read:
//
//   * the context menu (right-click), which shows everything, grouped;
//   * ONE primary button on hover, chosen from the row's own state — the
//     branch whose remote is gone offers "Delete", the one that is ahead offers
//     "Publish", and the ordinary one offers "Switch";
//   * the command palette, which is this list flattened and searchable.
//
// Keeping it as data rather than JSX is what makes the three agree. It also
// makes the rule testable without rendering a panel: see gitActions.test.ts.
//
// `command` is the git the action runs, shown to the user before anything
// irreversible happens. Not every action has one — some are three commands or a
// dialog — and those simply do not offer it rather than showing a lie.
