/*
 * Which lanes of the pull-request board are folded away.
 *
 * The board was the ONE container fold in this app that forgot itself. Every
 * other one persists — the tasks rail, the browser's spaces, Docker's stacks —
 * and this one held its state in a `useState({})` that nothing read or wrote.
 * Worse than a fresh start each launch: the panel mounts the board
 * conditionally, so typing one character in the filter unmounted it and took
 * the folds with it.
 *
 * TWO CONVENTIONS PICKED ON PURPOSE, because the audit that led here counted
 * eleven container folds in this app using four state shapes and three
 * localStorage namespaces, with the polarity flipping between them:
 *
 *   the key      `agentglass.<surface>.<thing>` — the majority spelling, the
 *                one with forty keys behind it. Not `agx.` and not `agx_`.
 *   the polarity what is SHUT, like the tasks rail and the browser. A list of
 *                the closed ones means a lane added tomorrow arrives OPEN,
 *                which is the answer somebody wants for a lane they have never
 *                seen. Storing the open ones would hide it.
 *
 * Reconciled against the lanes that exist on read, the way `taskSources.ts`
 * does it, so a lane that is renamed or dropped cannot leave a fold behind
 * pointing at nothing.

/**
 * The lane that cannot be folded away.
 *
 * "Needs your review" is the lane this board exists for — the sentence at the
 * top counts it, and a person folding it has hidden the only column that is
 * asking them for something. Two folds in this app already override the user
 * for the same reason and both wrote down why: Docker reopens a stack that has
 * just broken ("the reason to collapse one is that it is fine and you want the
 * room"), and the tool feed refuses because "a folded failure is worse than no
 * fold at all".
 *
 * This is the gentler form of the same rule — it never folds rather than
 * unfolding itself later, so nothing moves under the hand that is clicking.
 *
 * ONLY WHILE IT HOLDS SOMETHING, which the first version of this missed. The
 * argument above is entirely about a lane that is asking you for something: a
 * lane at ZERO is asking for nothing, and it was still taking 268 pixels of a
 * board that does not fit five columns, with a control that refused — a lane
 * that cannot be folded under a heading reading `0 NEEDS YOUR REVIEW`.
 *
 * Both halves matter and they do not conflict. Empty, it folds like any other.
 * The moment something lands in it, `foldable` says no again — and because a
 * fold is only ever REFUSED and never undone, a lane that fills up while folded
 * stays folded rather than springing open under the hand that is clicking. It
 * still says its count on the folded strip, which is how you find out.

 * What the keyboard walks in a lane, which is not what the lane holds.
 *
 * Pulled out of the component because it is the one piece of the fold that a
 * render cannot show: a cursor sitting on a card behind a 44px strip looks
 * exactly like a cursor sitting on a card. The first version of this fold had
 * no test for it at all — the assertion that should have caught it passed with
 * the guard deleted, which is how a hole this shape stays open.
 *
 * A folded lane walks as EMPTY, which is this app's own answer three times
 * over. `DockerPanel.ordered` puts it best: "so j/k walks what is on screen,
 * skipping collapsed stacks rather than jumping into a container nobody can
 * see". Without it the board's own heal does not fire either — it only rescues
 * a lane with nothing in it, and a folded lane with six cards reports six.
