// Which lane a pull request belongs in, and why.
//
// The board answers one question — what wants something from me — and a lane is
// the answer for one pull request. The classification is here, on its own,
// because it is the whole design: get it wrong and the board is a prettier list
// with the rows in a worse order.
//
// Two rules shape everything below.
//
// A pull request is filed by WHAT IT NEEDS, not by what it is. "Approved and
// green" is not a state, it is a job — press merge. "Red checks" is not a state
// either, it is "reviewing this is wasted work until it moves". So the lanes
// are verbs, and the order they are tested in is the order of what would stop
// you: something in your way before something in somebody else's.
//
// And every card carries the sentence that put it there. A board that sorts
// without saying why is a board you have to re-derive every morning; the
// sentence is the difference between "this is in Blocked" and "this is blocked
// because the same two checks have failed three runs running, so it is not
// flake". That sentence is built here too, from the same facts the lane was
// decided on, so the two can never disagree.
