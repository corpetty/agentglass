/**
 * Who a section of the Diff view is — the words for it.
 *
 * The server says which live sessions wrote into each checkout (see
 * server/src/sharedtree.ts). One author is the case the per-checkout grouping
 * is honest about, and the heading names it. More than one is the case it is
 * not: a change in the section can be any of theirs, and a file more than one
 * of them edited has a single diff on disk that nothing can split by author. That is
 * said on the heading and on the row, rather than left for the reader to infer
 * from a list that looks exactly as confident either way.
 *
 * Kept free of React so it can be tested without a renderer.
