// the thing asking is the notification list in the top bar, which can be open
// over any view, and the PR panel may not be mounted at all when it is pressed.
// So the request is left here, the shell switches to the PR view, and the panel
// picks it up the moment it exists.
//
// It carries the repo as well as the number because a number alone is not an
// identity — `#1175` names a different pull request in every repository, and
// the panel is pointed at one repo at a time. The panel decides what to do when
// they disagree; this only reports what was asked for.
