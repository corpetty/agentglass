/*
 * Searching settings by row, not just by page.
 *
 * settings-search-reaches-every-row.test.ts kept every page's `kw` bag honest
 * about the rows drawn on it, but `kw` answers a narrower question than the
 * one people actually type: "sound" finds Notifications because "sound" is a
 * word IN it, but "chime" does not, because nobody writes every synonym of
 * every row into a keyword bag by hand — that bag is already the second
 * place a row's words have to be kept in sync, after the row itself. This
 * module is pure (no React, no DOM) so it can be driven by settingsRows.gen.ts
 * — the rows read out of the pages, not typed twice — and unit-tested without
 * mounting a component.
 *
 * Two things live here that a `kw` bag cannot do at all: a synonym ("chime"
 * for "sound") and an honest "no" for a setting that was never going to
 * exist ("proxy" — there is no proxy setting, and there will not be one; the
 * app reads HTTPS_PROXY from its own environment).
