/**
 * The window's half of "let an agent drive the browser".
 *
 * The server parks the agent's HTTP request and sends the ask down the socket
 * (see server/src/browserdrive.ts); this runs it against the guest and reports
 * back. Kept out of the panel so the interesting part — what each verb actually
 * does to a page — can be tested against a stand-in element instead of a real
 * Chromium.
 *
 * Everything reaches the page through `executeJavaScript`, which is the only
 * door the webview tag offers, and that is exactly why the verbs are a closed
 * set with no `eval` among them: the code below is written here, and a selector
 * arriving from outside is embedded as a literal rather than pasted into a
 * template. A selector is data. It has been a source of injection everywhere it
 * was ever treated as anything else.
 *
 * The literal is built by `jsLit`, which is the repository's one answer to
 * this and not `JSON.stringify` — JSON is not a subset of JavaScript, and the
 * server's gate on a selector refuses a newline while letting U+2028 through.
 * See `shared/jsLit.ts`.
