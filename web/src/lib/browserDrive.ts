 * The window's half of "let an agent drive the browser".
 *
 * The server parks the agent's HTTP request and sends the ask down the socket
 * (see server/src/browserdrive.ts); this runs it against the guest and reports
 * back. Kept out of the panel so the interesting part — what each verb actually
 * does to a page — can be tested against a stand-in element instead of a real
 * Chromium.
 *
 * Everything reaches the page through `executeJavaScript`, which is the only
 * door the webview tag offers, and that is exactly why the verbs are a closed
 * set with no `eval` among them: the code below is written here, and a selector
 * arriving from outside is embedded as a literal rather than pasted into a
 * template. A selector is data. It has been a source of injection everywhere it
 * was ever treated as anything else.
 *
 * The literal is built by `jsLit`, which is the repository's one answer to
 * this and not `JSON.stringify` — JSON is not a subset of JavaScript, and the
 * server's gate on a selector refuses a newline while letting U+2028 through.
 * See `shared/jsLit.ts`.

 *
 * These are the decisions the panel makes about that, lifted out of the
 * component. Not for tidiness: under `bun test` there is no DOM, effects never
 * run, and the panel's ask handler is unreachable — so a rule that lives
 * inside it is a rule with no lock on it. Out here each one is a function with

/*
 * CHECKUP — "did it break?", in one call.
 *
 * The in-page collector (COLLECTOR) cannot answer it for a load: it is
 * injected after the document's own scripts ran, so an error thrown or a
 * request failing DURING LOAD is never seen, and `console`/`network` answer
 * `rows: []` for a page that died on its first line. An init script is no fix
 * — main.js measured that `Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument` on a
 * <webview> guest is gone after one navigation.
 *
 * Measured on an isolated instance: with Runtime, Log, Network and Audits
 * enabled through the guest's debugger BEFORE a reload or a loadURL, the CDP
 * event buffer (main.js `guestCdpEvents`, drained by `cdpEvents`) holds
 * `Runtime.exceptionThrown` for a TypeError at load, `Network.responseReceived`
 * with status 500 and `Log.entryAdded` level error source network — for a
 * reload and for a navigation alike. So a checkup that navigates enables them
 * first, then navigates, and reads the buffer.
 *
 * AND TURNS THEM OFF AGAIN. Left on, Runtime is something an anti-bot script
 * can detect and it keeps every logged object alive; a busy page fills the
 * 500-event buffer between checkups and pushes out the `Debugger.paused` that
 * `debug` is waiting for; and every other drain steals events from the next
 * window. Ceiling: a caller that had enabled any of the four itself through
 * `cdp` has to enable it again after a checkup.
 *
 * Which is why a checkup that does NOT navigate never touches the protocol:
 * it reads the collector, which the panel injects on every navigation, so
 * everything after load is there. Its window is in the PAGE's clock.
 *
 * Only errors, failed requests and visible error text count as problems.
 * Chromium's issues, perf and a11y are advice: a page with a missing alt is
 * not broken, and a verdict that says so teaches the caller to ignore it.
 *
 * Ceilings, chosen: draining takes EVERY buffered event of the tab, so a
 * `Debugger.paused` (or anything another verb was waiting for) that arrives
 * during a checkup is consumed by it. A load noisier than the buffer loses its
 * oldest events, and the answer says so. A request that never ends (an
 * EventSource, a long poll) keeps the page from ever being quiet, and the
 * checkup then stops at its cap and says `settledBy: "cap"`.
