// Terminal. So making the shell text bigger also made the terminal bigger, and
// making the terminal readable meant leaving the terminal, opening a dialog and
// finding a stepper.
//
// One gesture, two targets, chosen by where you are pointing. Over a terminal
// it is the terminal's font; anywhere else it is the window. That rule needs no
// mode, no toggle and nothing to remember — you are already pointing at the
// thing you want bigger.
//
// The pointer position is tracked rather than asked for, because a keyboard
// event carries no coordinates: `Ctrl+=` has to know where the mouse is, and
// the only way to know is to have been listening.

 * Is the pointer over a web page the browser is showing?

 * what the first draft of this did. Measured on the running app: the point at
 * the centre of the `<webview>` comes back as a `DIV`, because the panel lays
 * its own surfaces over the guest — the drag target, the find bar, the shade
 * while a page loads. `closest("webview")` was therefore false everywhere on
 * the page, and the whole branch below never ran once.
 *
 * A terminal can be asked the other way because its DOM is this document's.
 * A guest's is not: `<webview>` is a hole in the page with another process
 * behind it, so the only thing this document can honestly say about it is
 * where it is.
 *
 * AND ONLY A WEBVIEW THAT IS ON SCREEN, which a rectangle does not tell you.
 *
 * The workspace keeps every view mounted and hides the inactive ones with
 * `visibility: hidden` — deliberately, because `display: none` measures a
 * terminal at zero and reflows it to one column. A hidden box keeps its layout,
 * so the browser's guest still had a full-size rect behind whatever view was
 * actually up, and this answered "yes, the pointer is over a web page" from the
 * task board, the pull requests, anywhere. Ctrl+ then zoomed a page nobody was
 * looking at, the app never grew, and the browser was left at 350% for the next
 * time it was opened.
 *
 * `visibility` inherits, so asking the guest is asking every ancestor at once.

   * registered. `zoomTarget` never resolves a guest itself — only the panel
   * knows which tab is on screen, and a second resolver is the exact shape of
   * the bug that had captures photographing the wrong tab.
   *
