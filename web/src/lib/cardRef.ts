/*
 * The card a pull request came from.
 *
 * ClickUp already draws the other half of this link: open a card and its
 * sidebar lists the pull requests that mention it. Standing on the pull request
 * there is nothing — the card id is sitting in the branch name and in the body,
 * and reading it means selecting text and pasting it somewhere else.
 *
 * So it is read here, from what a pull request already carries. Two sources,
 * and they are not equally trustworthy:
 *
 *   the body's ClickUp address   certain — nothing else writes clickup.com
 *   an id in the branch/title    a convention, and other trackers share it
 *
 * That difference is reported rather than smoothed over (`from`), because the
 * caller has to decide with it: a Jira shop whose branches are `ABC-12-thing`
 * must not be shown a ClickUp mark for a card that does not exist.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT read is any card a TEMPLATE mentions, and that is
 * not a precaution — it is measured. Across fourteen real pull requests, twelve
 * resolved to the same card, because the checklist every one of them is written
 * from links a card of its own ("A/B testing only — see ORBIT-3306"), and it is
 * above the reference. So boilerplate is skipped by shape rather than by
 * wording: template links live inside checklist items, a card reference is
 * written as a line of its own. See `addresses`.

/**
 * A human card id: capitals, a hyphen, digits.
 *
 * Every bound here is doing the same job — keeping ordinary branch names out of
 * a feature that otherwise puts a ClickUp mark on a Renovate PR. None of them
 * are hypothetical:
 *
 *   fix/UTF-8-decode                    one digit, so not an id
 *   release/v2-1409                     lower case, and a digit in the prefix
 *   .../types/node-22-10-1              lower case — this is the one that bites
 *
 * Capitals is the load-bearing rule, and it is not arbitrary: an id is a proper
 * noun and gets written as one, by ClickUp's own "create branch", by every
 * template, and by anybody copying it out of the address bar. Somebody who
 * lower-cases theirs loses the chip on the branch — and keeps it via the
 * address in the body, which is where most of these come from anyway.
 *
 * The id must start the string or follow a separator, so `agent-v2` cannot lend
 * its tail to something that looks like an id. What follows it may be a hyphen
 * — a branch is `ORBIT-1042-what-it-was-about` — but not a word character, so a
 * number is never matched half-way.
