 * documented way to make one arrive is to assign the comment to them, so the
 * picker records who was named and the send hands that over.
 *
 * All of it is string work, kept away from the textarea so the awkward parts
 * are testable: an `@` in the middle of an email is not a mention, one typed
 * before an existing word replaces the right span, and a name with a space in
 * it has to come back out of the text intact.
