/**
 * The decisions behind "delete N merged", separated from the panel that asks
 * them — because getting one wrong deletes somebody's work, and a decision
 * buried in a component is a decision nobody can test.
 *
 * Two things live here: which branches can be deleted outright versus which are
 * pinned by a worktree, and — once the server has reported what is inside those
 * worktrees — which of them we are actually willing to remove.
 *
 * The second one shipped broken. It read
 *
 *     byPath.get(path)?.error ?? true
 *
 * to mean "unreadable", which is true whenever `error` is absent — that is,
 * every time the server answered perfectly. Every branch with a worktree was
 * refused with "no answer from the server" while the server was right there
 * answering. Neither the type checker nor the server's own tests could see it:
 * the expression is well-typed and the endpoint was correct. Only exercising
 * this decision with a successful report catches it, which is why it is now a
 * function that can be handed one.

 * up), so an unproven branch is not the same as a branch with unlanded work.
 * Refusing outright left people with a toast that clears itself in 2.6s and no
 * next step but a terminal. So it is still offered, named as unproven, with the
 * cost stated and the reflog window that can undo it.
