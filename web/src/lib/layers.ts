// What is on top of what, when two portals are on screen at once.
//
// Written down because guessing it cost a build. Portal sets its z-index on the
// CONTAINER it appends to <body>, so the numbers written on the elements inside
// only order them against their own siblings: a palette at 10001 inside a
// container at 9999 still renders underneath a viewer whose container is 10020.
// It looked right in the source and was wrong on the screen, which is the only
// place a stacking order exists.
//
// Two numbers in one file so the comparison that matters can be asserted rather
// than reasoned about — see layers.test.ts.

   * the gear mounted Settings UNDERNEATH it: two scrims stacked, the catalog
   * still on top, and to the person clicking it the gear did nothing and the
   * app went black.
   *
   * The trade, stated because it is real: this puts Settings above the toast
   * band (10040–10060) that it used to sit under, so a note toast that arrives
   * while Settings is open is now behind it. That is the same place the catalog
   * has always been, so the two rail sheets at least behave alike; moving the
   * toasts above both is a bigger change than this one.
