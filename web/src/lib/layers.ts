// CONTAINER it appends to <body>, so the numbers written on the elements inside
// only order them against their own siblings: a palette at 10001 inside a
// container at 9999 still renders underneath a viewer whose container is 10020.
// It looked right in the source and was wrong on the screen, which is the only
// place a stacking order exists.
//
// Two numbers in one file so the comparison that matters can be asserted rather
// than reasoned about — see layers.test.ts.
