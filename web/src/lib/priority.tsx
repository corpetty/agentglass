/*
 * ONE PRIORITY MARK, EVERYWHERE.
 *
 * The board drew ClickUp's logo — two chevrons — beside a card id; the tasks
 * view drew a flag in the priority's own colour; the pull request panel drew
 * the chevrons again. Three surfaces, three answers to "how urgent is this",
 * and only one of them actually said anything: "in some places it shows those
 * arrows and in others the flag... it has to be consistent and only use the flag,
 * in the priority's colour".
 *
 * The chevrons are a BRAND MARK. They say which tracker the card lives in,
 * which nobody is asking, and they say it in the exact spot the eye goes
 * looking for how much this matters. The flag answers the question and carries
 * the colour, so it replaces the logo rather than joining it.
 *
 * This module exists because the catalogue was a `const` private to
 * TasksPanel.tsx. A second surface wanting the same colours had to either
 * import from a 9,000-line component or copy four hex values — and copying is
 * how the three answers happened in the first place.

 * and 9.5px text produced 17px and 20px boxes. Two chips on one line at two
 * heights is the kind of thing you see before you can say what is wrong with it.
