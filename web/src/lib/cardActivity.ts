// One timeline for a card: what people said, and what happened to it.
//
// The tab used to be Comments and hold only the conversation, which left the other
// half of a card's story — who opened it, when, and how it moved through the board
// — available only by opening the website. Asked for as: "I would like to see all
// those details that show up in activity… they should not count as comments, but
// they are there as a history of what happened".
//
// Two rules come straight from ClickUp's own Activity pane, and both matter more
// than they look:
//
//   the count stays comments. A card with four comments and thirty status changes
//   is a card with four comments. The number on the tab is what somebody scans a
//   board with, and inflating it with automation would make it useless.
//
//   a RUN of events folds. ClickUp collapses consecutive history rows behind "Show
//   more" and it is not decoration: a bug card opens with fifteen "set field X"
//   rows before the first sentence a person wrote, and unfolded they push the
//   conversation off the screen. "That way the scroll does not get huge and you go
//   straight to what matters, which is the comments."
//
// Everything here is pure: it takes the detail the panel already fetched and
// returns what to draw, so what folds and what does not is testable without a DOM.
