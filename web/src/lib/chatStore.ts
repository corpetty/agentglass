 * Fold one live hook event into the chat watching that session.
 *
 * The chat panel had no live subscription at all: `hydrate()` ran once when the
 * tab was created and nothing ever updated it again. So a resumed session was a
 * photograph — you picked up a conversation, the agent carried on working in
 * the terminal, and the panel sat on whatever had been true at the moment you
 * clicked. The only streaming path was the response body of your own
 * `POST /chat/send`, which exists for exactly as long as a turn you typed.
 *
 * The socket already carries everything needed to keep it honest —
 * `UserPromptSubmit` has the prompt, `Stop` the assistant's reply, and the
 * tool pair the call and its output — so this is a matter of routing, not of
 * new plumbing. Called from the one place `useLive` is consumed.
 *
 * That last paragraph is true of Claude Code and only partly true of Codex, and
 * the difference is worth stating rather than discovering. Codex reaches this
 * app over OpenTelemetry rather than over hooks, and its log records carry the
 * shape of a turn but not its words: `logRecordToEvent` in server/src/otlp.ts
 * can build `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` / `Turn complete` out of them, and
 * there is nothing there to build `UserPromptSubmit` or `Stop` from. So a Codex
 * session watched from here fills in its tool rows and stays silent between
 * them.
 *
 * It matters less than it sounds. A chat's own turns are drawn from the
 * `/codex/send` response, which carries everything; this path only covers a
 * session *adopted* from the fleet, and for those the conversation is replayed
 * from Codex's own rollout on disk when the chat opens (`hydrate`).
