/**
 * What "Update branch" is actually going to do, said before it does it.
 *
 * The button merges the base into the head ON GITHUB. That is the whole
 * operation, and it always was — but the copy of that branch on this machine
 * is a commit staler for every press, and nothing on the screen ever said so.
 * You find out later, from a push that is rejected or a diff that disagrees
 * with the pull request you just read.
 *
 * So the label carries the second half when there is one to carry, and when
 * there is not, the row says why in a sentence rather than doing something
 * clever. Only one state leads to a write here: a local branch that can be
 * fast-forwarded. Divergence, uncommitted work and a checkout in the middle of
 * a merge are all reported and left alone — this machine runs a dozen
 * worktrees with agents inside them, and moving somebody's HEAD to save them a
 * `git pull` is not a trade worth making.
