/*
 * What the floating bench is holding, and where it is.
 *
 * A store rather than component state, for the reason every other cross-view
 * thing in this app has one: the bench is mounted at the shell and is opened
 * from everywhere — a chord, a diff's Open, the viewer's edit toggle, a menu in
 * the tab bar. A component that owned this would make each of those callers
 * reach into it.
 *
 * Three things live here and they have different lifetimes, which is why they
 * are not one blob:
 *
 *   the window    where it sits and how big it is. ONE of these for the app,
 *                 because there is one window — that decision is in the design
 *                 notes: several floating windows is a desktop to tidy, and you
 *                 already have one of those.
 *   the button    where you dragged it to. Kept as a PERCENTAGE of the viewport
 *                 and not in pixels: this machine runs a 1.5 scale on one
 *                 monitor and 1 on the other, and a button remembered in pixels
 *                 comes back off-screen.
 *   the tabs      per CHECKOUT, not per app. Switching worktree switches which
 *                 set you are looking at, and the other set is not closed — it
 *                 is somewhere else, still running, because its tabs are tmux
 *                 sessions on the engine.
 *
 * Nothing here talks to the server. A tab is a description of what should be on
 * screen; the components below it are what connect.
