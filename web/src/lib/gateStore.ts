 * gate hold is the one event in agentglass with a running agent stopped at the
 * other end of it, and the panel that renders them is mounted only on the
 * dashboard. Polling from that panel meant agentglass stopped noticing new
 * holds the moment you opened the workspace, which is the same mistake
 * sysNotify.ts already documents about tying its socket to the notch.
 *
 * It also raises each new hold onto the notch. That is the part that matters:
 * the only other "come and look" signal was `notify-send`, spawned by the
 * server, which a desktop Do Not Disturb setting swallows without telling
 * anyone. An in-app note cannot be silenced by a setting agentglass does not
 * own, so the request survives whatever the desktop is doing.
