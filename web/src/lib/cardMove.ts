/*
 * Moving the card the pull request came from, at the moment it lands.
 *
 * The gap this closes is a habit, not a feature: merge in the panel, then go
 * to ClickUp and drag the card out of Code Review by hand — and sometimes not,
 * because nothing on the merge asked. The card is already known here (the chip
 * next to the title is `cardRef`), and the board it lives on already publishes
 * what its columns are called, so the one thing missing was being asked.
 *
 * The rules live here rather than in the dialog because they are the part with
 * consequences — a wrong pick writes to somebody's real board — and because a
 * status is not a value you can reason about from its name. Status NAMES are
 * per-list: one board's "Code Review" is another's "In review" and a third's
 * "PR up". Nothing here may branch on the words.

/**
 * The card to offer moving, or nothing.
 *
 * Stricter than the chip that links to it, and deliberately: the chip opens
 * something, this WRITES to somebody's board. A reference read out of a branch
 * name is a convention other trackers share — `ABC-12-thing` is what a Jira
 * shop's branches look like too — so it is only offered when something
 * corroborates it. A ClickUp address in the body is proof by itself. A prefix
 * we have actually read from this workspace's own cards is the other proof.
 * With neither, the honest answer is to say nothing rather than open a merge
 * form offering to move a card that does not exist.
 *
 * All of which is about the CARD, and there is a question before it: can this
 * machine write to ClickUp at all. Without a token it cannot, whatever the
 * evidence — so a pull request carrying a clickup.com address, which is proof
 * of a card and no proof of a connection, used to open a merge form that spun
 * on "Looking up ORBIT-1042 on ClickUp…" before admitting there was no ClickUp
 * to look in. That is a real body: a fork of a team that uses ClickUp, or a
 * contributor who pasted a link. Asked first, so the rest is never reached.
