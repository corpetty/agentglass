 * removing a container, answering a gate. The gates table keeps the fate of
 * every held tool call, which is not the same set: a request the timeout
 * allowed, or one a restart found already expired, changed what an agent did
 * and appears in no action row at all, because nobody made a request for it.
 *
 * An audit trail with a hole in it is worse than none — you stop looking for
 * the missing line — and "the outcomes nobody chose" is the hole most worth
 * closing, since those are exactly the ones nobody remembers.
 *
 * Where the two overlap, the gate record wins. It is the same event told
 * better: the actor is on the row itself, the summary is not clipped to share
 * 120 characters with the tool name, and the reason a human typed is there,
 * which the action log never carried.

 * fold keeps the timestamp of its FIRST member and carries the whole count
 * across the boundary, so one day is credited with events that happened on the
 * other. Measured on his own database — 200 rows, one fold of

 * Both ends of a heading are a claim about what happened THAT day, and a fold
 * that reaches past the heading above it breaks both at once. Grouping first
 * makes the boundary a wall the fold cannot cross, which is also what a reader
