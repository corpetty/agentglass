 * The commit graph, as lanes and edges — not as `| | * | \ \`.
 *
 * `git log --graph` draws its own picture in ASCII, and the Log tab was
 * printing that picture as text in a monospace column. On a repository with
 * twenty-seven live branches it is forty characters wide before the commit
 * subject starts, so every message read `fix(pr-revi…` and the tab looked, in
 * the author's words, like it broke on the way down.
 *
 * The shape is not in the drawing, though — it is in the PARENTS, which git will
 * hand over for a fraction of the cost of `--graph`'s topological walk. So the
 * server sends those and this turns them into something a browser can draw:
 * which column each commit's dot sits in, and which lines pass through the row
 * on their way somewhere else.
 *
 * Pure, and tested next door: the whole of the difficulty here is bookkeeping
 * (a merge frees a lane, a fork claims one, and the row in between has to be
 * drawn with the lanes it had at the TOP and the lanes it has at the BOTTOM),
 * and none of that needs a DOM to be got wrong.
