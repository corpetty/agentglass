/*
 * One find bar for the whole app, and the rule for what it searches.
 *
 * There were five finders before this — the diff's, the markdown viewer's, the
 * terminal's, the browser's, the board's filter — each with its own key and its
 * own idea of what "find" means, and four views with nothing at all. So Ctrl+F
 * in a pull request's description did what the browser's own find does: search
 * every view stacked behind it too, because the workspace keeps them mounted.
 *
 * The thing that makes this hard is not searching. It is deciding WHERE, and
 * the answer is not "the view you are looking at":
 *
 *   - the workspace keeps every visited view mounted and hides the inactive
 *     ones with `visibility: hidden` (Workspace.tsx), so the document holds
 *     several screens' worth of text nobody can see;
 *   - thirty components render through `Portal` into `document.body` — Settings,
 *     a card, the file viewer — so half the app is NOT inside its view's box.
 *
 * Hence a STACK of scopes rather than a pointer to a view. The active view
 * pushes itself; anything that opens over it pushes itself on top; the find bar
 * searches whatever is on top, which is what somebody looking at a dialog means
 * by "this page". It is the same rule a browser applies to a <dialog>.
 *
 * A view whose content is not DOM — the terminal's canvas, the browser's
 * webview — registers an ENGINE instead, and the bar drives that. Nothing about
 * those two changes except which key opens them.
