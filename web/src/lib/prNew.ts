// three comments deep inside a thread opened two days earlier, and finding it
// took several minutes of scrolling a conversation that gave no sign it had
// moved. Two causes, and only one of them is GitHub's.
//
// Ours is the ordering. A thread entered the timeline at the timestamp of its
// FIRST comment, so a live argument on an old thread was filed under the day it
// started — invisible to a "newest first" sort, because to the sort that thread
// really was two days old.
//
// GitHub's is that a conversation has no notion of "since you last looked". The
// unread state it keeps is per notification, not per pull request, and it is
// gone the moment you glance at the page from anywhere else.
//
// Everything here is pure and takes the detail the panel already loaded. No
// request is made and nothing is stored on the server: the one piece of state
// is a timestamp per pull request in this browser, which is enough because the
// question is "since *I* last looked", and only this browser knows that.
