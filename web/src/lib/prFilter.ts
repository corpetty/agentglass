// The PR list's filter model (#pulldash-style facets).
//
// One rule holds the whole thing together: the query STRING is the single
// source of truth. `FilterState` is a pure `parseQuery(query)` derivation, never
// stored; the facet dropdowns are editors of the string (toggle -> parse ->
// mutate -> serialize -> setQuery). Two independent states that must "never
// disagree" is the bug this design refuses to have — there is only one state,
// so the bar and the menus cannot drift.
//
// Grammar: `key:value` tokens plus bare free-text words, space separated, keys
// case-insensitive, double-quotes for values with spaces (`label:"needs work"`).
// parseQuery is TOTAL: unknown keys, partial tokens, and unclosed quotes all
// degrade gracefully (to free text or to no-constraint), never throw, never
// silently empty the list.
//
// Semantics: OR within a facet, AND across facets. Two authors selected shows
// PRs by either; adding a label then intersects. This is a deliberate
// divergence from github.com's raw search (where repeated `label:` is AND) —
// a multi-select checkbox facet has to be OR, or ticking a second box can only
// ever shrink the result to zero, which reads as broken.
