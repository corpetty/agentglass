// Never replace an answer with "not yet".
//
// The pull request list arrives in two passes on purpose: the rows in about a
// second and a half, the check rollups four seconds behind them, because the
// rollup is a separate walk per pull request and nobody opening the panel is
// waiting for it. A row from the first pass carries `checksLoaded: false` and
// an empty rollup — and zeroes for the diff stats, which come back in the same
// second pass.
//
// That is fine the first time. It is not fine on the fourth: every later fetch
// starts at the fast pass too, so a board that had the real answer on screen
// replaced it with the empty one and got it back a few seconds later. Reported
// from the app as the board loading correctly, going blank-ish — every card
// reading "Still reading its checks" — and then coming right on its own.
//
// So a refresh may add and it may correct, but it may not un-know: where the
// new row says the second pass has not run and the old row had it, the old
// answer stands until a real one replaces it.
