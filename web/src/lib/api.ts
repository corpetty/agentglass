 * The gap between the window appearing and the sidecar listening.
 *
 * `electron/main.js` deliberately does not wait for the server before opening
 * the window — waiting cost 376ms of a 588ms startup warm and up to twelve
 * seconds cold, and a launch that shows nothing reads as an app that failed.
 * The comment there justifies it on one claim: "every panel's fetch has a retry
 * or an honest loading state". This is the half of that claim that was missing.
 *
 * Measured from source on 2026-08-26: the sidecar listens 559ms after spawn and
 * answers /health at 635ms. Every request the renderer fires before then is
 * refused, and a count of the call sites showed 16 of them turn "I could not
 * ask" into "the answer is nothing" — `setRepos([])`, `setAgents([])`,
 * `setEditor({ hasNvim: false })` — which is indistinguishable from a real
 * empty answer and never re-runs. Reported as "the browser often does not
 * start"; one launch's console carried 20 of these.
 *
 * So the gap is closed once, here, rather than in sixteen `.catch`es.
 *
 * A REFUSED CONNECTION is worth asking again; AN ANSWER IS NOT. `fetch` only
 * throws when the request never reached a server, so that is the whole test —
 * a 500 or a 404 arrives as a resolved Response and falls through untouched,
 * because asking a struggling server twice is how a bad minute becomes a bad
 * ten. GET only, and that is not a limitation: it is the verb whose repetition
 * cannot mean anything, and the startup burst is all GETs.

 * does not make the console quiet — Chromium logs every refused request whether
 * or not the caller asks again, so retrying turned 19 console errors into 31.
 * Recovering and being quiet are different problems and this is the second one.
 *
 * The shell already knows the answer. `ensureServer` polls until /health says
 * "ours" and then calls `reportSidecar(null)`, which arrives here through
