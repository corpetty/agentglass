 * looking for it. Someone who runs the app daily has no reason to open that

 * mean anyone received it.

 * A module-level store rather than a hook, for the same reason gateStore.ts is
 * one: the answer belongs to the app, not to whichever surface happens to be
 * mounted. The notch and the settings button both read it, and neither has to
