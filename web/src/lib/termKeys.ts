 * The key that opens find: Ctrl+Shift+F, or Cmd+F where Cmd is not the shell's
 * to begin with.
 *
 * Deliberately not plain Ctrl+F. #8 asked for it, and every other app binds it,
 * but in a terminal it is already taken: readline reads it as forward-char, and
 * less, vim and emacs all page forward on it. Binding it here would break the
 * program running in the shell to add a feature to the panel around it. The
 * terminals that have solved this — VS Code, GNOME Terminal, Konsole — settled
 * on Ctrl+Shift+F for the same reason.
