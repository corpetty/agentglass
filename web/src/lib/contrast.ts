// past legible — which matters more than it sounds, because 555 places in this
// app ask for one of them, including a lot of text that is not chrome at all.

// right. It measures each tier against the background it will actually sit on
// and lifts only the ones that fall under a contrast target, keeping the hue
// and keeping the ladder — a lifted `--text3` is never brighter than `--text2`.
