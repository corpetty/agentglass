/*
 * How a diff opens, before anybody touches the toggles.
 *
 * Three panels show diffs — file changes, source control, pull requests — and
 * all three opened side-by-side with no wrapping, hardcoded, in three separate
 * `useState` calls. That is a defensible default and it is not everyone's: a
 * 13" screen has no room for two columns, and long prose lines in a markdown
 * diff are unreadable without wrapping.
 *
 * These are DEFAULTS, not the live state. The toggle in each panel still wins
 * for as long as you are looking at that diff — changing your mind about one
 * file is not a preference, and a control that quietly rewrote your settings
 * every time you pressed it would be a control nobody could use for a glance.
