/*
 * A review of a local diff, sent to an agent as one prompt.
 *
 * The pull request panel already has line comments that collect into a pending
 * review; this is the same shape for the working tree, where the recipient is an
 * agent in a chat rather than GitHub. So the review ends as TEXT: every comment
 * becomes `path:line`, the code it was about, and what was said — the agent is
 * never left finding the code from a description of it.
 *
 * The one thing that makes it survive a working agent: the snippet is captured
 * when the comment is written, not when the review is sent. An agent editing the
 * file moves the anchor; the comment is then shown as stale and still sends the
 * code it was written against. A review that quietly re-anchors to whatever is on
 * that line now is worse than no review.
 *
 * Kept by checkout root, in localStorage: a review is a thing you build up over a
 * few files and several minutes, and navigating to the chat to look something up
 * must not throw it away. Per browser, like the read ticks beside it — this is a
 * draft, not a record.
