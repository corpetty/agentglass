 * view each half of a diff is one of them. So the nearest one to a matched LINE
 * was a pane that scrolls sideways and not at all vertically — every `scrollTop`
 * written to it was a silent no-op, with no scroll event to notice it by. A file
 * card's nearest one is the page, which is why jumping to a FILE worked and
 * jumping to a line inside that same file did not.
 *
 * So this asks the question that was always meant: walking up from the element,
 * which ancestor has more content than height AND is allowed to scroll it. Only
 * `auto`/`scroll`/`overlay` count — `clip` and `hidden` overflow more than they
 * show (the file cards are `overflow: clip`) and would swallow the jump.
