/**
 * What a note is allowed to do when it arrives.
 *
 * Every note behind the bell has a SOURCE — the Lantern, an agent asking, a
 * desktop app — and a LEVEL, its urgency. The two answer different questions:
 * the level decides how loud a note may be, the source is what a person can
 * say "not this one" about. Before this there were two unrelated switches and
 * neither was either: Quiet only reached the mirrored notes, and the switch for
 * agentglass's own alerts was all or nothing, so a desk of five agents put
 * dozens of rows behind the bell in an hour and "Quiet on" still showed them.
 *
 * Three levels, one rule each:
 *
 *   urgent (2)  something is STOPPED until a person acts. Always interrupts —
 *               popup, sound, badge — and cannot be muted by source.
 *   normal (1)  news. Badged; interrupts only with Quiet off.
 *   quiet  (0)  a row, findable, with its destination. No badge, no sound.
 *
 * Quiet is on by default: the calm reading of the bell is "only what is
 * stopped reaches you", and turning it off is a choice somebody makes.
 *
 * Mirrored desktop notes are never louder than normal and never interrupt with
 * Quiet on — the desktop already drew its own popup for them, so ours was the
 * second copy of the same interruption.
