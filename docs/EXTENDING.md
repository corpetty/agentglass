# Extending agentglass / make it yours

agentglass is a **visibility + control-plane layer** you point agents and
harnesses *at* — not a harness you replace. Feed it events, watch the cockpit,
optionally hold dangerous tool calls until a human decides. The extension
surfaces below already exist in the tree; this guide only documents them.

## 1. Point any agent at agentglass

Two intake paths:

| Path | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /ingest` | Custom hooks / scripts that already speak agentglass events |
| `POST /v1/traces` + `POST /v1/logs` | Anything that can emit OpenTelemetry GenAI (`gen_ai.*`) |

### Minimal `/ingest` event

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:4000/ingest \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "source_app": "my-harness",
    "session_id": "sess-001",
    "event_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "hook_event_type": "PostToolUse",
    "payload": { "tool_name": "Bash", "tool_response": "ok" },
    "model_name": "gpt-4.1-mini",
    "reported_cost_usd": 0.00042
  }'
```

Required fields: `source_app`, `session_id`, `hook_event_type`. Each must be a
non-empty string no longer than 64 KiB.
Optional: `payload`, `chat`, `model_name`, `event_id`, `reported_cost_usd`.
Invalid JSON, missing required fields, an empty / over-512-character `event_id`,
or a cost outside the finite `$0`–`$100,000` range returns `400`.

`event_id` is an opaque retry key, unique within one `source_app` + `session_id`.
Generate it with at least 128 bits of randomness (UUIDv4 is a good default);
`/ingest` is a local telemetry endpoint, so predictable keys can be claimed by
another local process before the real event arrives. The first write wins.
Reposting it returns the original event id as
`{"ok":true,"id":123,"duplicate":true}` without changing session totals,
search, alerts, or the live stream.

`reported_cost_usd` is an authoritative cost for this one event. Use it when the
harness already knows what the provider charged; `0` is valid. Without it,
agentglass derives cost from token usage and its pricing table.

If a Claude transcript scanner already owns the session id, the event is
accepted but skipped (no double-count).

### Kimi Code CLI and Kimi K3

Kimi Code CLI's hook JSON already supplies `hook_event_name` and `session_id`,
and Kimi runs the command in the session's project directory. Point Kimi at
`hooks/send_event.py`; `--model-name` supplies the model because Kimi's hook
payload does not include it.

Add one block per event to `~/.kimi-code/config.toml` (or
`$KIMI_CODE_HOME/config.toml`). Replace `/absolute/path/to/agentglass` with this
checkout's real path:

```toml
[[hooks]]
event = "SessionStart"
command = "python3 \"/absolute/path/to/agentglass/hooks/send_event.py\" --model-name kimi-code/k3"

[[hooks]]
event = "UserPromptSubmit"
command = "python3 \"/absolute/path/to/agentglass/hooks/send_event.py\" --model-name kimi-code/k3"

[[hooks]]
event = "PreToolUse"
command = "python3 \"/absolute/path/to/agentglass/hooks/send_event.py\" --model-name kimi-code/k3"

[[hooks]]
event = "PostToolUse"
command = "python3 \"/absolute/path/to/agentglass/hooks/send_event.py\" --model-name kimi-code/k3"

[[hooks]]
event = "PostToolUseFailure"
command = "python3 \"/absolute/path/to/agentglass/hooks/send_event.py\" --model-name kimi-code/k3"

[[hooks]]
event = "Stop"
command = "python3 \"/absolute/path/to/agentglass/hooks/send_event.py\" --model-name kimi-code/k3"

[[hooks]]
event = "SessionEnd"
command = "python3 \"/absolute/path/to/agentglass/hooks/send_event.py\" --model-name kimi-code/k3"
```

The source app defaults to the current project directory's name. Pass
`--source-app NAME` to override it. On Windows, use `py` or `python` instead of
`python3`.

Hooks provide the live lifecycle and tool stream. Kimi's hook payload currently
does not include token usage. A Kimi/Moonshot adapter can add exact tokens and
cost through `/ingest` using either supported API shape:

```json
{
  "source_app": "my-project",
  "session_id": "kimi-session-1",
  "hook_event_type": "Stop",
  "model_name": "kimi-k3",
  "payload": {
    "usage": {
      "prompt_tokens": 1200,
      "completion_tokens": 300,
      "cached_tokens": 800
    }
  }
}
```

The OpenAI-compatible nested form
`prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` is supported too. Cached tokens are split
out of `prompt_tokens` before cost math, so they are not charged twice.
Agentglass recognizes `k3`, `kimi-k3`, and `kimi-code/k3` as **Moonshot / K3**.
The built-in K3 API rate follows
[Kimi's published pricing](https://www.kimi.com/help/kimi-api/api-pricing):
$3 / MTok input, $15 / MTok output, and $0.30 / MTok cache reads. Use
`reported_cost_usd` for Kimi Code subscription usage or whenever the provider
reports the exact charge.

### OTLP (any provider)

Point an OTLP/HTTP exporter at the same port. Both **protobuf** (SDK default)
and **JSON** are accepted:

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4000
# traces go to POST /v1/traces
# GenAI log records (e.g. Codex CLI) go to POST /v1/logs
```

Mapping (see `server/src/otlp.ts`):

- Tool spans (`execute_tool` / `gen_ai.tool.name`) become PreToolUse + PostToolUse
  (span id becomes `tool_use_id`, so latency percentiles work).
- LLM spans become a "Turn complete" event with token usage for cost math.
- Spans without `gen_ai.*` attributes are ignored (this is not a general
  trace store).

One-command CLI wiring (Gemini / Codex) is documented in the README under
**Any provider — via OpenTelemetry**.

### Adding a CLI you can talk to, not only watch

OpenTelemetry gets a CLI onto the radar. Driving one from the chat panel is a
separate seam, and Codex is the worked example of it — `server/src/codex.ts`
alongside `server/src/chat.ts`. The division that makes it cheap:

- **The server spawns and streams, and does not translate.** It runs the binary
  non-interactively in a scoped git directory and pipes its JSONL back verbatim,
  plus an `agx_error` frame of its own when the process never got going. Every
  guard is shared — `safeAbs` / `repoRootOf` / `inScope`, the `setsid` process
  group so stopping a turn reaches the whole job tree, the keepalive, and the
  first-run watchdog that names the login command.
- **One file in the browser knows the vocabulary.** `web/src/lib/codexFrames.ts`
  turns Codex's `item.completed` frames into the same `ChatMsg` / `ChatTool` /
  `ChatUsage` the Claude path fills. Nothing below the store branches on which
  CLI produced a turn, which is what lets one panel render both.
- **The differences that remain are real ones, and are surfaced rather than
  papered over.** Codex has a sandbox where Claude has permission modes; it
  reports cumulative thread tokens where Claude reports per-turn; it reports no
  cost and no context window at all. Each of those is a visible difference in
  the panel, not a fabricated equivalence.

A third CLI repeats that shape, and Google Antigravity is the proof it holds:
`server/src/antigravity.ts` beside the other two, `web/src/lib/antigravityFrames.ts`
beside `codexFrames.ts`, and `AgentKind` gaining a member. What the third one
changed is worth knowing before you add a fourth:

- **The per-agent differences moved into a table.** `AGENTS` in
  `web/src/lib/agents.ts` holds the label, the binary, the defaults, the
  unattended mode, and whether the CLI takes attachments or has a replayable
  transcript. Two agents justified `agent === "codex" ? … : …`; three did not,
  because a missed branch is silent — a Claude default quietly applied to
  something that is not Claude. Add the entry, not the branches.
- **An agent may report through the panel itself.** Claude reaches the fleet
  over hooks and Codex over OpenTelemetry, but Antigravity exports neither, so
  its own stream is teed into `ingestBody` — `frameToEvent` maps frames to
  `SessionStart` / `UserPromptSubmit` / `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` /
  `Turn complete`. That is the `via: "chat"` kind in the agent roster. It only
  covers chats started here, which is said plainly rather than implied.
- **Check what the usage numbers actually mean before trusting them.** Codex
  reports cumulative thread totals and Antigravity reports per-turn figures.
  They look identical on the wire and are assigned in one case and added in the
  other; getting it backwards over-reports spend severalfold and nothing fails
  loudly.
- **A capability the CLI has not got is left off, not faked.** Antigravity has
  no readable transcript (protobuf inside SQLite), no price, and no context
  window, so there is no resume route and the cost and context rows stay hidden
  rather than being filled from a table in this repo.

## 2. Use the gate in your own harness

`POST /gate` is a generic approval primitive: hold an action until a human
decides in the dashboard (or a timeout resolves it).

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:4000/gate \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "source_app": "my-harness",
    "session_id": "sess-001",
    "tool_name": "Bash",
    "tool_input": { "command": "rm -rf build" },
    "timeout_ms": 60000
  }'
# response: { "decision": "allow"|"deny", "reason": "..." }
```

Contract:

- **Fail-open by default** — timeout or unreachable server does not block the
  agent. Set `AGENTGLASS_GATE_FAILCLOSED=1` to invert that for security-sensitive
  use.
- Timeout floor 1s, ceiling `max(120s, AGENTGLASS_GATE_TIMEOUT)`.
- Dashboard list: `GET /gate/pending`. Decide: `POST /gate/decide`
  with `{ "id", "decision": "allow"|"deny", "reason"? }` (CSRF-protected for
  browser origins).
- **Durable.** Every request is persisted on arrival, so a server restart
  re-hydrates the queue instead of stranding held agents. Send your own uuid as
  `"id"` and the POST becomes idempotent: re-sending it re-attaches to the same
  request rather than raising a second prompt.
- **Reconnect** with `GET /gate/status?id=<your uuid>` when a held connection
  drops. It holds open while the request is pending, answers immediately once
  decided, and **404s on an id it has no record of** — treat that as "no answer"
  and apply your own policy, never as an approval.
- Resolved requests: `GET /gate/history?limit=50`. `resolution` says who decided
  — `human`, `timeout`, or `restart` (the window closed while the server was
  down). The last two are the outcomes nobody chose, which is exactly why they
  are recorded rather than dropped.

Claude Code wiring lives in `hooks/gate_event.py` (see README control-plane
section). Any harness can long-poll the same endpoint.

## 3. Drive the UI from outside (`POST /control`)

The dashboard is keyboard-navigable, and `POST /control` exposes that same
navigation to anything on the machine — a Stream Deck, a phone, a shell script.
It is the one write route that grants **no capability the keyboard doesn't**: a
command changes only what is *shown* (which view, whether the workspace is open,
the theme), never the fleet, so it needs no gate beyond the `localOrigin` +
token checks the whole surface already carries.

The server validates the body against a closed set (`server/src/control.ts`)
and rebroadcasts it as a `control` frame on `/stream`; every open tab runs it
through the very setters the keyboard handler uses (`web/src/lib/controlBus.ts`
→ `App.tsx`), so external and keyboard navigation are one path, not two.

```bash
# open the workspace on the git view
curl -sS http://localhost:4000/control \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{ "cmd": "view", "to": "git" }'
```

`ControlCmd` (see `shared/types.ts`), anything else → `400`:

| `cmd` | Fields | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `view` | `to`: `dash`\|`git`\|`diff`\|`pr`\|`tasks`\|`docker`\|`term`\|`chat`\|`browser`\|`files` | switch the window to that view |
| `workspace` | `open?`: boolean | toggle (absent) or set — swaps between the dashboard and the last view, the way `Ctrl+\` does |
| `esc` | — | close panels / workspace, as Escape does |
| `open` | `what`: `stats`\|`skills`\|`search`\|`help`\|`palette` | open that panel |
| `theme` | `name?`: id, or `dir?`: `1`\|`-1` | pin a palette, or step the list |
| `zoom` | `dir`: `1`\|`-1`\|`0` | zoom in / out / reset — **desktop app only**; in a browser tab it is accepted and does nothing, because the browser's own zoom already covers it |
| `chat` | `do`: `new` | open the chat view on a fresh tab |

`chat` is the one command the receiving client cannot run on arrival: the chat
panel is mounted only while the workspace is open, and `new` is exactly what you
press when it isn't. It is latched in a one-slot mailbox
(`web/src/lib/chatIntent.ts`) that the panel drains once it is up, and that
lapses after 30s so a tab which never opened doesn't act on it much later.

Approve/deny and monitoring need no bridge — they are already `POST /gate/decide`
and the `/stats`, `/insights`, `/gate/pending`, `/stream` reads. `/control` fills
the one gap: UI navigation. It is gated by `AGENTGLASS_TOKEN` like every route
but the intake sinks, so a non-browser caller (no `Origin`) is admitted on a
loopback bind and must carry `Authorization: Bearer <token>` when one is set.

## 4. Make it yours

### Theme

Copy an entry in `web/src/lib/themes.ts`:

```ts
export interface Theme {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  preview: { primary: string; secondary: string; accent: string };
  vars: Record<string, string>; // CSS custom properties on :root
}
```

Add a palette to `THEMES`, restart the UI, pick it in the theme switcher.
`applyTheme(id)` writes CSS vars and `localStorage["agentglass-theme"]`.

### A view in the workspace

The views are a list, and the rail, the shortcuts and the tooltips all read
from it — so most of a new view is one entry:

```ts
// web/src/components/workspace/views.ts
export const VIEWS: ViewDef[] = [
  { id: "git", label: "Git", key: "g", icon: GitIcon, hint: "Stage, commit, push/pull the working tree" },
  // …add yours here
];
```

That list is not quite the whole story. A view id is validated on the server too
(`POST /control` accepts a closed set), so adding one means four files, not one:

| File | What it needs |
|---|---|
| `shared/types.ts` | the id in the `ViewId` union |
| `web/src/components/workspace/views.ts` | the `VIEWS` entry above — rail, hotkey and tooltip all read it |
| `web/src/components/workspace/Workspace.tsx` | the body to render for that id |
| `server/src/control.ts` | the id in `VIEW_IDS`, or `POST /control` rejects it with `400` |

The list is deliberately duplicated at the trust boundary rather than imported
from the UI: a `/control` body is untrusted input, and it is checked against a
closed set before anything is broadcast.

`key` is the bare letter that reaches it from the dashboard; the modified
shortcut comes from its position in the rail, or from whatever the user has
bound in **Settings ▸ Shortcuts**. A view added in a later version appears for
someone whose saved rail order predates it, rather than being silently dropped.

Give the panel the shared header so it cannot drift from the others:

```tsx
import { ViewHeader } from "./workspace/ViewHeader.tsx";

<ViewHeader title="My view" count={items.length} actions={<button>…</button>}>
  {/* controls that scope the view — a repo picker, an engine chip */}
</ViewHeader>
```

The height is fixed rather than derived from padding, on purpose: a view that
later adds a taller control would otherwise grow its own header and the frame
would twitch when you switched to it. Use `useSidebarWidth()` and `SidebarGrip`
for a list pane and it inherits the same draggable width as everything else.

### Scope and config

Persisted at `~/.config/agentglass/config.json` (env vars still win):

```jsonc
{
  "root": "~/code/my-project",
  "repoDirs": ["~/code", "/mnt/hdd/code"]
}
```

Or at launch:

```bash
AGENTGLASS_ROOT=~/code/my-project bun run dev
# desktop: make desktop-open DIR=~/code/my-project
```

With a project open, git writes / terminal / chat outside that root are refused —
scope is a boundary, not only a filter. Multi-repo work: scope to the parent
folder instead.

### Auth and write gates

See the README security table (`AGENTGLASS_TOKEN`, `AGENTGLASS_GIT_WRITE_DISABLED`,
`AGENTGLASS_DOCKER_WRITE_DISABLED`, `AGENTGLASS_CHAT_DISABLED`,
`AGENTGLASS_CODEX_DISABLED`, …). Intake routes
(`/ingest`, OTLP) stay tokenless on purpose — local hooks and OTel exporters
have no way to carry a secret — while everything else needs the token when set.

## 5. How it stays live

```
hooks / OTLP / POST /ingest
        |
        v
   normalize -> SQLite ---> WebSocket /stream
        |                        |
        +---- alerts ---- dashboard (useLive)
```

- Server persists events, then broadcasts on `/stream`.
- `web/src/lib/useLive.ts` opens one WebSocket, buffers frames (~220ms flush,
  ~5 renders/sec), pauses React updates while the tab is hidden, and reconnects
  with backoff (gives up after ~2 minutes of continuous failure; becoming
  visible again retries).
- Initial frame can include recent history + open tool calls so a reload is not
  a blank cockpit.

## Dashboard vs harness (one paragraph)

agentglass does **not** replace Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, LangChain, or
your custom runner. Those remain the harness. agentglass is the glass in front
of them and the optional remote control: ingest telemetry, render the fleet,
and (if you wire it) hold tool calls until a human clicks allow/deny. Point
things at it; keep shipping with whatever you already run.
