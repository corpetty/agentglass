#!/usr/bin/env bash
# An isolated agentglass desktop instance for agx-bench: its own port, its own
# config, data, cache, state, database and tmux, all under one directory, so a
# benchmark run never reads or writes the instance somebody is working in.
#
#   scripts/agx-bench/instance.sh start  [DIR] [PORT]   # boots it, waits for the browser panel
#   scripts/agx-bench/instance.sh status [DIR]
#   scripts/agx-bench/instance.sh stop   [DIR]          # stops only what start started
#
# DIR defaults to /tmp/agx-bench and PORT to 4831. DIR must stay short: tmux
# refuses a socket path longer than ~107 bytes, and the socket lives under it.
#
# The window. Electron has no working headless mode here (`--ozone-platform=
# headless` crashes Electron 43), and the browser guest only paints inside a
# real window. On Hyprland the window goes, silently and without focus, to a
# workspace of the real monitor that nobody works on (5, or
# AGX_BENCH_WORKSPACE), and `start` refuses while that workspace is on screen.
# No virtual output: a headless one shows up to the person as a second screen
# and breaks their screenshots, so none is ever created. Hyprland's exec rules match the window by
# PID, so the command it runs is this script's `_exec`, which `exec`s the real
# Electron binary — the node wrapper in node_modules/.bin would start the
# window from a child PID and the rules would be ignored without a word.
# Anywhere else the window simply opens (set AGX_BENCH_NO_WINDOW_RULES=1 to
# force that path on Hyprland too).
#
# D-Bus. The instance gets no session bus at all (`disabled:`). A private bus
# (dbus-run-session) is worse, not better, for a Chromium: it D-Bus-activates
# a second copy of the desktop portal on that bus, which crashes when the bus
# closes and raises a crash notification on the desktop.
#
# Stopping is by recorded PID and by the PID holding this instance's own port,
# never by a process-name pattern: a pattern also matches every other copy of
# the same binary on the machine.
