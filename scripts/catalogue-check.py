"""Re-derive a catalogue pull request's entry from the pull request itself.

    python3 scripts/catalogue-check.py <base plugins.json> <head plugins.json>

The approval workflow writes an entry and pushes it on a branch; this is the
check that branch has to pass before it merges, and it trusts nothing the
approval run said about itself. It reads the two versions of the catalogue,
finds what changed, clones the named repository at the pinned commit, and
checks that the entry is what that commit holds:

  - exactly one entry is added or replaced, and nothing else in the file moves;
  - a replaced entry keeps its repository (a new version, not a new owner);
  - the ref is a full commit and the hash is a sha256;
  - the commit is on a branch or a tag of that repository, not only a fork's;
  - the id, the publisher, the scope, the places it draws, the app version it
    needs and the title are what the manifest at that commit makes them;
  - a fresh clone at that commit validates and hashes to the pinned hash;
  - `verified` is false, and the project's name is not a stranger's byline;
  - the preview, if any, is read at the pinned commit.

It clones a stranger's repository, and like every other job that does, it
runs nothing from it: the manifest is read and the tree is hashed.

Exit 0 when the entry holds, 1 when it does not, 2 when the input is not
two catalogues. One line per problem, each an `::error::` for the run's page.
