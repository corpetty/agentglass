/**
 * Does the server grow?
 *
 * "No growing shit over time" is the hardest of the performance asks to satisfy
 * by inspection, because leaks do not show up in a request — they show up in a
 * machine that has been running the app since Monday. This app is left open all
 * day by design: a dozen shells, panels polling, a transcript scanner sweeping,
 * caches on nearly every read. Every one of those is somewhere for memory to
 * quietly accumulate.
 *
 * So it runs the app hard for a while and watches its resident set. A leak
 * shows up as a line that keeps climbing; a healthy process settles, because
 * every cache in here is bounded and the rest is garbage.
 *
 *   bun scripts/soak.ts             # ~3 minutes, enough to see a trend
 *   AGX_SOAK_MINUTES=30 bun …       # long enough to be sure
 *
 * Not wired into CI. A soak that runs on every push is a slow build; this is
 * for the question "has it been getting worse?", asked deliberately.
