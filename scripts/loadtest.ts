/**
 * Does the terminal stay typeable while the panels hammer the server?
 *
 * `perfbudget.ts` proved the *loop* stays answerable, but it does it against a
 * fixture repo and an empty DB with a handful of endpoints on a gentle poll —
 * the calm case. The bug the user actually feels is the loud one: the real
 * 186MB database loaded, a repo with eighteen worktrees, and *several* panels
 * across *several* clients all polling git, docker, PRs, stats and the gate at
 * once. Under that the sidecar was seen at 72% sustained CPU with the spawn
 * pool pinned (peakInflight 16 / peakWaiting 16), and the in-browser terminal
 * stuttered — a keystroke's echo arriving a third of a second late.
 *
 * So this reproduces *that*, and measures the one number that is the bug: how
 * long the PTY takes to echo a keystroke while the fan-out runs. It also reports
 * the pure loop delay (an external ping), the server's own stall log with the
 * name of whatever blocked it (/api/loopwatch), the spawn-pool high-water marks,
 * and the sidecar's CPU — so a failure names its cause instead of just failing.
 *
 * Two properties make its numbers trustworthy:
 *   * The DB is a COPY of the real one (never the original, never in write), so
 *     the database cost is realistic — an empty DB is why `make perf` never
 *     reproduced the stutter.
 *   * The load and the measurement run in SEPARATE processes. The panel fan-out
 *     is dozens of concurrent fetches; run in the same event loop as the PTY
 *     probe it would starve the probe's own timers and the harness would be
 *     measuring itself. So a child process generates the load and this one only
 *     watches the terminal — the delay it sees is the server's, not its own.
 * The copy, the fixture repo, the child and the server are all torn down on exit.
