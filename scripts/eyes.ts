/**
 * A run cannot see the app it is asked to redesign — it can only reason about
 * CSS, and reasoning about CSS is how a 359x596 plugin card and a 6px focus
 * ring nobody could see both shipped. This is the fix: build this worktree's
 * own web bundle, serve it from an isolated throwaway server, and drive a
 * headless Chrome over CDP to screenshot it and, more importantly, MEASURE
 * it — a screenshot says something looks wrong, computed geometry says why.
 * A track that resolves to 0x0 (a bare `<span>` ignoring inline width/height)
 * and a card that renders at 359x596 both surfaced from `getBoundingClientRect`
 * + computed style, not from staring at a picture.
 *
 * Isolated so it can never touch the operator's real server: their shell
 * exports AGENTGLASS_TOKEN and AGENTGLASS_BIND=0.0.0.0, and inheriting either
 * makes every request 401 or points this at their real machine. Both are
 * scrubbed, alongside AGENTGLASS_WEB_DIR, which would otherwise serve their
 * installed app instead of the bundle this run just built.
 *
 *   bun scripts/eyes.ts                                   # shot of "/"
 *   bun scripts/eyes.ts --selector '.plugin-card'          # + geometry of it
 *   bun scripts/eyes.ts --path /?token=x --out /tmp/x.png
 *   bun scripts/eyes.ts --no-build                         # reuse web/dist as-is
 *   bun scripts/eyes.ts --do "document.querySelector('[title=Settings]').click()"
 *
 * Prints the screenshot path, then — if --selector matched something — the
 * JSON `getBoundingClientRect()` + a few computed-style properties of the
 * FIRST match, to stdout, so a run can grep the number instead of eyeballing
 * a picture.
