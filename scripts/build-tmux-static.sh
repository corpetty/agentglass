# Build a fully static tmux for one target, for bundling into the app.
#
# The pane engine's tmux is an implementation detail of the agentglass UI, so
# the desktop app and headless installs ship their own rather than depending on
# the system one. This script produces that binary:
#
#   ./scripts/build-tmux-static.sh            # host arch, ./out/tmux-<target>
#   TARGET=bun-linux-arm64 ./scripts/build-tmux-static.sh
#   SKIP_NCURSES=1 ...                        # reuse a previous ncurses build
#
# Targets (match the sidecar's bun targets):
#   bun-linux-x64      musl static   (zig cc)
#   bun-linux-arm64    musl static   (zig cc)
#   bun-darwin-arm64   clang static  (macOS SDK via clang)
#   bun-darwin-x64     clang static
#
# Requirements: curl, tar, a C toolchain. Linux targets additionally need
# zig (https://ziglang.org) on PATH; darwin targets use the system clang.
# Everything is pinned below; the checksums file is the one thing CI can refuse
# to build without, and a mismatch fails the build loudly rather than shipping
# an unverified binary.
#
# The result is statically linked (musl on Linux, full static on macOS) so the
# bundled binary has no libevent/ncurses dependency on the host — that is what
# makes "no tmux on the machine" irrelevant to the engine.
# `sha256sum` is GNU coreutils; macOS ships `shasum`. The release runners are
# both, and the first tag cut after these scripts landed died on a macOS runner
# with "sha256sum: command not found" — after downloading three tarballs.
# `nproc` is GNU; macOS has `sysctl -n hw.ncpu`. With neither, `make -j""` runs
# with NO limit — which is how the first macOS release build died: ncurses'
# makefiles raced and `make` reported "No rule to make target ../lib/libtinfo.a"
# for a library its own tree had not finished writing yet.

#     libSystem stays dynamic, as it does for every binary on that platform.
#   -s: a linker flag on GNU ld, obsolete on Apple's. `-Wl,-x` is the local
#     symbol strip that means the same thing here.
#   --host: tmux 3.5a's `config.sub` does not know `arm64-apple-darwin` and
