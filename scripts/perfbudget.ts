 * Does the server still answer while it works?
 *
 * The terminal's PTY rides the same single thread as every git call, docker
 * call and SQLite query this process makes, so "the event loop was busy for
 * 900ms" and "the terminal was dead for 900ms" are the same sentence. An
 * afternoon went into making that stop being true — four sync git reads
 * converted, a filter query that blocked 1432ms cached, a network call taken
 * off the thread, a scope filter that expanded to seventy-two predicates
 * rewritten — and none of it is protected by anything. The next `git()` on a
 * poll path undoes it silently, because every other check in this repo passes:
 * tsc is happy, the tests pass, the bundle boots. Only the clock disagrees.
 *
 * So this measures the clock. It pings a route that does no work at all while
 * driving the endpoints the panels poll, and fails if the loop stops answering
 * for longer than a keystroke can wait.
