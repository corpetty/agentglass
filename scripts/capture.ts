/**
 * Screenshots and the hero GIF for the README, from the demo build.
 *
 * The demo build and nothing else, deliberately. A real workspace has the
 * user's repository names, their branch tickets, their spend and their session
 * titles on screen, and this README is public — capturing a live app would put
 * whatever happened to be open that afternoon on the front page of the project,
 * permanently. `VITE_DEMO=1` renders the same UI over fabricated data, so what
 * ships is the design rather than somebody's Tuesday.
 *
 * Driven over CDP for the same reason the smoke test is: `Page.captureScreenshot`
 * returns exactly what compositing produced, and every step can wait for a real
 * condition instead of a guessed sleep.
 *
 *   bun scripts/capture.ts            # stills + hero.gif into .github/assets
 *   bun scripts/capture.ts --stills   # skip the GIF (much faster)
