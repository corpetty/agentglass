/**
 * Render the home-screen icons from the marks in the repository.
 *
 * Every icon this page offered was an SVG, and the places a phone actually
 * reads one from are the places that handle SVG worst: `apple-touch-icon` (iOS
 * ignores it and screenshots the page instead, so the home-screen icon was a
 * shrunken dashboard) and the manifest's install and splash path. Both want
 * rasters.
 *
 * They are generated rather than drawn, and the generator is checked in beside
 * them, because the alternative is four binaries nobody can regenerate when the
 * mark changes. Chromium does the rendering — it rasterises the same SVG the
 * browser would.
 *
 *   bun scripts/make-icons.ts        # rewrites web/public/*.png
 *
 * Re-run it whenever web/public/icon-app.svg or icon-maskable.svg change.
 * web/test/phone-icons.test.ts fails if a PNG a phone needs is missing or is
 * not actually a PNG.
 *
 * `icon-badge.svg` was here too, for the status-bar badge on a pushed
 * notification. Web Push is gone and nothing draws a badge, so keeping the
 * stencil would have meant regenerating art for a surface that no longer
 * exists.
