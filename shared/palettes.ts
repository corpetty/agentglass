/*
 * The colours both apps are built from: two base palettes and seven accents.
 *
 * This file exists because the phone got a theme. The desk has thirty-seven
 * palettes and a mode segment above them; the phone gets the IDEA without the
 * catalogue — dark or light, and one accent for the things that read as live.
 * Two palettes and seven accents is the whole of it.
 *
 * ── why the bases are the desk's own github-dark / github-light ──────────────
 * Because they are not new colours. Whatever else the two products differ in,
 * a phone showing a session and a desk showing the same session have to look
 * like one application; picking a fresh pair of greys for the phone is how you
 * get two. These two records are byte-for-byte what web/src/lib/themes.ts had
 * inline for those themes, which is why that file now imports them instead —
 * the desktop's offer is unchanged, it just stopped holding the only copy.
 *
 * ── why shared/ and not a copy ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Precedent, set in this repo today: sessionTitle moved to shared/ rather than
 * being duplicated, because four disagreeing copies of one rule is what forced
 * that move. A colour is the same kind of value — nobody notices the copies
 * drifting until two screens of the same product are different greys.
 *
 * ── the shape ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * camelCase, sixteen fields, and that is not arbitrary: it is exactly what the
 * server normalizes a theme to (`ThemeVars` in server/src/themesync.ts) and so
 * exactly what already travels between the machine, the phone, tmux and nvim.
 * The `--bg` spelling is one client's rendering detail, so it lives in the
 * converter at the bottom rather than in the values.

/*
 * The phone's own ground and ink, which are no longer the desk's.
 *
 * `BASE` above is github-dark and github-light, and it stays that on the desk:
 * a browser tab beside GitHub's own should not argue with it about what a
 * surface is. A phone has no such neighbour. It is held in one hand, in the
 * dark, at arm's length, and the two things it is mostly showing are a terminal
 * and a list of rows — so it is worth its own values.
 *
 * What changed and why, rather than "we picked nicer greys":
 *
 *   The ground goes DARKER and slightly cooler (#0a0c10 against #0d1117).
 *   github-dark is tuned to sit beside white browser chrome; a phone at night
 *   has nothing beside it, and the darker ground is what stops a full-screen
 *   terminal glowing in a dark room.
 *
 *   The hairline goes QUIETER (#232833 against #30363d) and the raised surface
 *   goes UP (#1a1f27 against #21262d). The desk separates things with borders
 *   because it has the pixels; the phone separates them with surface, because
 *   at 393 points a visible border around every row is most of what you see.
 *
 *   The mid ink goes UP (#a6b0bd against #c9d1d9 for secondary), because a
 *   phone is read outdoors and github-dark's third and fourth inks are close
 *   enough to disappear in sunlight.
 *
 * The light half is not github-light either, and not a photographic negative of
 * the dark one: it is warm where the dark one is cool. A cool near-white reads
 * as a screen that has been left on; a warm one reads as paper, which is what
 * a light mode is for.
 *
 * ── info stays a blue, and that is not an oversight ──────────────────────
 * The obvious move is to set `info` to the teal, since the teal is what this
 * palette is. It is wrong twice. In the UI it collapses two meanings into one
 * hex — an informational tone and a button you press stop being tellable apart,
 * and `info` is a semantic slot for the same reason `error` is. In the terminal
 * it is worse and it is silent: `deriveAnsi` picks ANSI blue by HUE, taking
 * `info` when it is near 220 and falling through to `primary` when it is not.
 * Teal is 171, so ANSI blue would become the accent — and on the NEUTRAL accent
 * the accent is the body text, which put the same hex in two of the sixteen
 * slots and made a `ls` colour vanish. Sixteen distinct slots is asserted in
 * mobile/test/term-ansi.test.ts, which is how this was found.
