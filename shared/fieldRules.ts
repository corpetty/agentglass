 * A DEAD SESSION IS NOT FORGOTTEN WORK.

 * dead for days, on the most expensive context on the machine.

 * machine can see, AND quiet long enough that "it is between panes" has
 * stopped being the likely story. An agent quiet for an hour with no pane
 * here is still worth asking about — it may be alive on another tmux

 *   hour it is nothing: that is most sessions most of the time.
 * - `forgotten`: claimed work gone quiet for an hour (`isForgotten`).
 *

 * `left`: the watch pushed "orbit-api is waiting for your next prompt — 3h"
 * while the strip, which set every ended turn aside, read "nothing running"
 * in the calm colour. Both call this now.
 *
 * The Lantern's own chat is never anybody's attention. A seat (`role`
 * "orchestrator") can be blocked or left like any agent, but never forgotten —
 * `isForgotten` sets every role aside, because a seat's `doing` is a chair
 * waiting for its owner. The watch alone sets seats aside entirely, because
 * its findings wake the seat and a seat must not be woken about itself. So a seat stopped on a permission is on the strip and not in the
 * notification — the one difference, and it is the reader's, not the rule's.
