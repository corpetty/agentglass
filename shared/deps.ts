// The outside tools agentglass shells out to, in one place.
//
// Every panel that needs a binary already probes for it and says so on its own
// (git, docker, gh, tmux). What nobody could answer was the whole question:
// "what am I still missing for this app to work end to end?" That answer needs
// a list, and a list needs a single source, or the wording drifts between the
// six places that already tell part of the story.
//
// It USED to say: generic on purpose, no package-manager lines, "how the reader
// installs software is theirs to know, not ours to guess". That reasoning was
// sound and the conclusion was wrong, so it is worth saying why it changed
// rather than quietly deleting it.
//
// The objection was that a guess is wrong for most readers and stale for the
// rest. True — and it only matters if the guess RUNS. What the panel does now
// is type the command into a real terminal and stop: the prompt is yours, the
// Enter is yours, and a wrong guess costs one keystroke to correct instead of
// installing the wrong thing. At that point a command that is right most of the
// time beats a link that is right always and helps nobody who is missing a
// package at 1am. It also means `sudo` is typed by the person who owns the
// machine, into their own shell, rather than asked for by an app.
//
// Two rules keep the guess honest:
//   * `pkg` is per manager and OPTIONAL. Where there is no one-line answer —
//     Docker, the Claude CLI — there is no entry, and the reader gets the
//     project's page exactly as before. A fabricated apt line for Docker would
//     install the wrong daemon from the wrong repository.
//   * Names nobody is sure of are left out rather than approximated. A missing
//     row costs a search; a wrong one costs a package.
