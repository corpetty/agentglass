// Why a pull request cannot be merged, said from what is actually true.
//
// GitHub's mergeable state is a single enum and it is coarser than the sentence
// people need. `UNSTABLE` means "a check is failing OR still running", and the
// panel translated it to "A check is failing" every time — so a pull request
// with 46 green checks and two still going was reported as failing, in a box
// whose very next line said "46 checks passed".
//
// Contradicting yourself inside one box is worse than saying nothing: the
// reader now has to work out which half to believe, and the half that says
// "failing" is the one that sends them to the browser.
//
// So the enum is the fallback, not the answer. The rollup already knows how
// many are red and how many are pending, and it is the same rollup the Checks
// tab renders — which is why that tab said "0 failing" while the header said
// the opposite.
