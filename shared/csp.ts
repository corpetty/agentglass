// The Content-Security-Policy agentglass serves the UI under, written once.
//
// The same web/dist is served from two origins and only one of them had a
// policy. The desktop shell hands the renderer out over its own
// `agentglass://app` scheme and put a CSP on it (electron/main.js); the sidecar
// hands the very same bundle to a phone, to a browser on the LAN and to
// whatever reaches a `tailscale serve` hostname, and sent no policy at all.
// That is backwards — the HTTP origin is the one a stranger can reach — so both
// now read this file and the test beside it (server/test/csp.test.ts) fails if
// they ever stop agreeing.
//
// Why either origin is worth a policy: the renderer is handed the machine token
// as a plain synchronous value (preload.js) next to IPC channels that import
// browser cookies and drive a browser, and the app renders pull-request and
// issue markdown from whatever repository the user happens to be triaging,
// through a hand-written converter, into several `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
// sinks. An XSS has already shipped through that converter once. So the
// load-bearing directives are `connect-src` — an injected script can reach this
// app and its own loopback sidecar and no outside host, which is what stops the
// token leaving the machine — and `script-src`/`object-src`/`base-uri`, which
// leave it nothing to inject in the first place.
