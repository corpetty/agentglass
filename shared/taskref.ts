/*
 * The work item a pull request came from, whoever tracks it.
 *
 * A pull request usually exists BECAUSE of something — a card, a ticket, an
 * issue. Standing on the pull request, that link is worth four characters of
 * chrome: it is how you tell two similarly-titled pull requests apart, and how
 * you get from a review back to what was actually asked for.
 *
 * ── it must work for somebody who has never heard of any of these ────────
 * Most people running this have no ClickUp. Some have Jira, some have Linear,
 * plenty have nothing but GitHub issues, and plenty have nothing at all. So
 * this reads what a pull request CARRIES and never assumes which product wrote
 * it, and the three answers it can give are:
 *
 *   nothing              null. No chip, no gap, no placeholder — the row is
 *                        simply one thing shorter. This is the common case and
 *                        the one that has to feel deliberate.
 *   an address           certain. The body named a tracker's own URL, and a
 *                        URL opens without anybody's credentials or setup.
 *   an id by convention  shown only when the caller says something is
 *                        connected that could resolve it, and never dressed in
 *                        a particular tracker's colours: `WEB-1042` is a shape
 *                        half the trackers in the world use, and being
 *                        confidently wrong about which one owns an id sends
 *                        people to a page that does not exist.
 *
 * ── what it deliberately does not do ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Guess a provider from the shape of an id. A tracker is named only when its
 * own address was in the body; otherwise `tracker` is null and stays null.
