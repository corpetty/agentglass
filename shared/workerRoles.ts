/*
 * The worker roles, and the lock each one runs under on whichever CLI it is
 * given.
 *
 * context-diet splits a job into three kinds of worker — a scout that finds,
 * a builder that changes, a verifier that runs the checks — and pinned each
 * one to a Claude model in its agent files. The cheap two are exactly the
 * work that does not need Claude at all, so the role, not the agent file,
 * now names a provider and a model, and a person picks them in Settings.
 *
 * ── the lock ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A role changes which CLI runs, so it cannot rely on that CLI's own config
 * to keep a worker from pushing: the person's opencode.json may allow
 * everything, and a project can ship its own. Every role therefore starts
 * with a deny list rendered into the layer of that CLI the person's and the
 * project's files cannot loosen (see `LockSpelling`), and a CLI with no such
 * layer is refused rather than run unlocked. OpenCode has no such layer, only
 * a merge, so its lock is checked against the merged rules at every start.
 *
 * What it cannot do: it is a list of command PREFIXES, and a CLI decides what
 * a prefix matches. An OpenCode agent switched to by hand in the TUI runs
 * under the project's rules for that agent, not these. `sh -c 'git push'` or a script that pushes is not a
 * command named `git push`. It closes the ordinary way a worker does the
 * thing it was told not to; it is not a sandbox, and the one this app has for
 * that is the local-review plugin's.
