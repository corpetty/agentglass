/*
 * THE DESKTOP'S OWN PALETTE, AS A THEME THIS APP CAN WEAR.
 *
 * "System" used to mean one bit: dark or light, off `prefers-color-scheme`,
 * mapped to the two neutral themes. On a desktop that themes every app it runs
 * — the terminal, the bar, the editor, the lock screen, all switched together —
 * that one bit is the only thing that did not follow, and this was the window
 * that stayed grey when everything around it turned blue.
 *
 * So a desktop that publishes a palette is read, and "System" wears it. This
 * file is only the translation — pure, so it is tested without a desktop. What
 * a palette is called on a given desktop, and where it lives, is the provider's
 * business (server/src/desktopPalette.ts).
