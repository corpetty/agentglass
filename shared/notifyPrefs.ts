// Everything the app can push at a person collapses into one of seven kinds.
// `blocked` is the one that earns an interruption by default: an agent truly
// stopped until a human answers (a gate hold, a permission prompt). The rest
// used to share that same urgency — a tool error, a branch falling behind, an
// agent merely idle — and arrived at the same volume as the thing that was
// actually waiting on him, which is how the one alert that mattered got lost
// in the sixty that did not. Off by default, visible where it already lives
// (the fleet card, the bell's history list), and a person can turn any of
// them back on here.
//
// `reminders` is the one exception, on by default alongside `blocked`: a
// reminder is a promise the person made to themselves at a particular minute,
// not agentglass deciding on its own that something is worth their attention.
