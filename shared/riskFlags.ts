/**
 * What an agent's edit touched that a reviewer should read first.
 *
 * The gate looks at a tool call before it runs; this is the other side, the
 * edit after it landed. Every rule is a match on the file's path or on the
 * lines the edit ADDED — never a model call — so the same edit raises the same
 * flag every time and the reason is one sentence a person can check against
 * the diff. A removed line is only counted for size and for a dependency line
 * disappearing: deleting a key from a file is the fix, not the leak.
 *
 * One copy, in `shared/`: the server attaches the flags to each change and
 * rolls them up per session, and nothing on the web side re-derives them.
 *
 * What it cannot see, said so the next person can tell a chosen limit from a
 * gap: only Edit/Write/MultiEdit are changes here, so a lockfile rewritten by
 * `bun add` in a shell, or a file removed with `rm`, raises nothing; a secret
 * shape not in SECRET_SHAPES is missed; and a manifest other than package.json
 * is flagged on any edit, because telling a dependency line from any other
 * line is only done for the one format whose dependency lines have a shape.
