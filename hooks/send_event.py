"""agentglass event forwarder.

Reads a Claude Code or Kimi Code CLI hook payload on stdin and POSTs a
normalized event to the agentglass server. Zero third-party deps (stdlib only).

Usage (from a Claude Code hook command):
    send_event.py --source-app my-project --event-type PreToolUse
    send_event.py --source-app my-project --event-type Stop --add-chat
    send_event.py --model-name kimi-code/k3
