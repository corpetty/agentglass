"""agentglass hook installer.

Wires the agentglass event forwarder into your Claude Code settings so every
session streams to the dashboard — no hand-copying required. Zero third-party
deps (stdlib only).

    python3 hooks/install_hooks.py               # install into ~/.claude/settings.json (global)
    python3 hooks/install_hooks.py --uninstall   # remove the agentglass hooks
    python3 hooks/install_hooks.py --project .   # install into <project>/.claude/settings.json instead
    python3 hooks/install_hooks.py --postinstall # lifecycle mode used by `bun install`

Notes:
  * Idempotent — re-running re-points the send_event.py path in place and never
    duplicates entries or disturbs your other hooks (magia, guards, etc.).
  * It also takes the `statusLine` slot, CHAINING whatever was there: Claude Code
    pipes `rate_limits` to that command on every turn, which is the plan usage
    the dashboard would otherwise pay a rate-limited endpoint for. Your own
    status line is passed the same stdin, owns the output, and comes back
    untouched on --uninstall. POSIX only; skipped on Windows.
  * The target settings file is backed up (`*.bak.agentglass.<timestamp>`) before
    any change, and only when there is actually a change to make.
  * `--source-app` is intentionally omitted so each project auto-labels in the
    dashboard by its own working-directory name (send_event.py defaults to the
    cwd basename).
  * `--postinstall` respects `AGENTGLASS_NO_HOOKS=1` (skips) and never fails the
    install, so `bun install` stays green even without Python or write access.
