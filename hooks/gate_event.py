"""agentglass control-plane gate (OPT-IN).

A PreToolUse hook that holds a tool call until you approve or deny it from the
agentglass dashboard. Point a project's PreToolUse hook at this to gate its
tools remotely.

    python3 hooks/gate_event.py --source-app my-project

Safety by design — it NEVER blocks your agents by accident:
  * if agentglass is unreachable or errors → allow (exit 0, no output)
  * if no one decides within the timeout → the server auto-allows
  * only sessions wired to this hook are gated; everything else is untouched

Durable across a server restart: the hook picks the request id, so if the
connection drops mid-wait (agentglass restarted, a crash, a proxy hanging up)
it re-attaches to that same request instead of giving up and falling into the
timeout branch. It only gives up once its own deadline has passed.

Deny/allow are returned to Claude Code via the PreToolUse permissionDecision.

    outside agentglass is nothing at all. Since the desktop app runs its sidecar
    with a token even on loopback (electron/main.js), reading only the
    environment would leave every gate post unauthenticated: /gate answers 401,
    the HTTPError branch below cancels the retry loop, and the call lands in
    fail-open. The gate would stop holding, silently, with nothing on screen to
    say it had.

    0600 and owned by this user, so being able to read it is the check. An
    unreadable file is not an error — a server started without a token wants no
