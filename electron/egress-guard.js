// The boundary between the browser and the network: where a name becomes an
// address, and the one place the URL policy can be held at connect time.
//
// `safeUrl` in server/src/browserdrive.ts judges the LITERAL host of a URL
// before it is handed to the browser: link-local (169.254/16, where the cloud
// metadata endpoint lives, and fe80::/10) and the unspecified address are
// refused; loopback and the private ranges are deliberately allowed, because a
// dev server on this machine or a box on the LAN is ordinary use. A hostname
// passed through untouched, with a note that resolving it there would be a
// race nobody wins — and it would: the browser resolves the name again when it
// connects, and a name is free to answer differently the second time. That is
// DNS rebinding, in two shapes. A name that answers 169.254.169.254 from the
// start is a metadata read wearing a hostname. A name that answers a public
// address while the policy looks, and a loopback or LAN one when the page's
// own script fetches it a minute later, is a page reaching a service on this
// machine under an origin that service trusts.
//
// Both close only where the address is USED, so this module is the network
// step: a forward proxy on a loopback port that every browser session is
// pointed at. Each connection resolves its name once, judges every address the
// name answered, and opens the socket to the address it judged — there is no
// second resolution for a flip to land in. HTTPS is a CONNECT tunnel, the TLS
// inside it untouched; plain HTTP is forwarded one request per connection.
//
// The rules, in the order a connection meets them:
//   - a literal address is judged as it is, and never pinned: it IS the answer.
//   - a name that does not resolve is refused — the connection would fail
//     anyway, and this way the reason is said.
//   - any answer that is link-local or unspecified refuses the whole name: a
//     name with one public record and one link-local one is a name whose owner
//     wants the second used.
//   - an answer set that mixes a public address with a private one (loopback,
//     RFC1918, CGNAT, unique-local) is reached at its public addresses only,
//     and the name is public from then on. Multiple-A-record rebinding is the
//     page loading from the public address, that port closing, and the next
//     connection falling through to 127.0.0.1 under the same origin; the
//     first version pinned such a name private and tried the addresses in
//     order, which is exactly that. Refusing the name outright closed it too,
//     and broke a dual-stack LAN box (an RFC1918 A record beside a global
//     AAAA), which a home network with IPv6 hands out as a matter of course.
//   - a name is remembered by class, and "public" is sticky: a name that has
//     EVER answered public is public from then on, and a private answer for
//     it is refused. That is the rebinding shape. The first version pinned the
//     FIRST answer only, so a page could pre-pin its name private with one
//     early request, answer public for the attack page, then answer loopback,
//     and every step passed. A name that has only ever answered private stays
//     allowed — `myapp.test` in a hosts file, a LAN box, a tailnet name —
//     which is what keeps local development working without an allow-list.
//     A private name that moves to a public address is fine (a dev box that
//     grew a public name); it is the way back that is refused.
//   - only public names are remembered, and a pin is never evicted. A private
//     answer needs no memory: judged fresh every time, it is allowed every
//     time, and the moment the name answers public it is pinned. The first
//     version remembered both classes and evicted FIFO, so a page could
//     request N fresh subdomains, push its own public pin off the front, and
//     be pinned fresh as private. The memory is bounded, and when it is full
//     a NEW public name is refused with the reason: a page grinding through
//     hostnames gets a loud refusal of new names, never a silent hole; names
//     already pinned, and every private name, keep working. The memory lasts
//     as long as the app does.
//
// What this cannot do, written down so a gap is not read as a choice:
//   - Chromium sends localhost, 127/8, ::1 and link-local LITERALS straight to
//     the network, never to a proxy. Loopback literals are allowed anyway;
//     link-local ones are refused by `literalRefusal` on the session's request
//     hook, which sees the URL and cancels the request.
//   - a proxy the operator sets on the session replaces this one, and with an
//     upstream proxy the name is resolved there: the pin is off while it is set,
//     and the session verb says so.
//   - a laptop whose VPN turns a public name private mid-session meets the
//     rebinding rule, because from here the two are the same event. The
//     refusal names the way out: a restart, or AGENTGLASS_BROWSER_EGRESS=off.
//   - the pins live in memory, and a restart forgets them while a `persist:`
//     partition does not forget its service workers and cache. A page kept
//     from an earlier run can ask its own name again after a restart, when
//     that name already answers loopback, and nothing says it was public.
//   - the memory is one per app, not per site: a page that walks 100k fresh
//     subdomains fills it, and every new public name is refused, for every
//     tab, until a restart. Loud and bounded, not silent — but a denial.
//   - there is no authentication on the port. It answers loopback only, and
//     everything it does is refuse: a process on this machine that can reach
//     it can reach the network directly and gain nothing by going through.
//
// CommonJS with no dependencies, like guest-guard.js and for the same reason:
// main.js requires it, and web/test/browser-egress-guard.test.ts loads it
// under bun and runs the proxy against real sockets without Electron. Keep it
// in `build.files` in package.json — left out of the asar, the app does not
// start.
