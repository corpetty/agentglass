// disable-gpu-compositing below) to dodge a Wayland/GPU white-out; raster still
// runs on the GPU, WebGL does not. Same pixels as the web app.
//
// It serves web/dist from the app's own `agentglass://` scheme and brings the
// Bun server up with it unless one is already running.
//
// The scheme is not cosmetic. This used to be a loopback HTTP server on an
// EPHEMERAL port, which meant the renderer's origin changed on every launch --
// and localStorage is keyed by origin, so every restart handed the app an
// empty store: theme, display size, chats, drafts, the saved token and every
// preference, all silently reset. A fixed port would have fixed persistence
// but reintroduced the bug the ephemeral port was chosen to avoid (a second
// instance failing to bind). A custom scheme has neither problem: one stable
// origin and no port to contend for. Only one instance runs now (see the lock
// below), but the origin is what makes the store survive a restart.

 * Which windowing backend this app is, on Linux. Pinned, on purpose.
 *
 * What used to be here was `ozone-platform-hint=auto` plus
 * `enable-features=UseOzonePlatform`. Both were deleted rather than kept "just
 * in case": Chromium removed `--ozone-platform-hint` in M140 (= Electron 38,
 * `ui/ozone/public/ozone_switches.cc` now defines only `ozone-platform`,
 * `ozone-dump-file` and `ozone-override-screen-size`), and the
 * `UseOzonePlatform` feature no longer exists either. They were not merely
 * doing nothing — they were two lines telling the next reader that this file
 * chooses a backend, when it had stopped choosing anything.
 *
 * So it chooses one now, and it chooses it FROM THE SESSION. Not a constant —
 * a constant is wrong in one direction or the other, and both directions were
 * measured.
 *
 * DO NOT PIN "x11". That was the first attempt, for the reason below, and it
 * failed in the worst shape there is: on GNOME 46 / Wayland with Chromium 150 the
 * packaged app started, brought the sidecar up, served :4000, answered /health —
 * and never mapped a window. Nothing on screen, no crash, no non-zero exit; the
 * main process had connected to no display server at all. The GPU process says
 * why, and still does today:
 *     ui/base/x/x11_software_bitmap_presenter.cc:147
 *       XGetWindowAttributes failed for window 1
 * With AGENTGLASS_GPU=1 (so this is not the white-out workaround below) it is the
 * same, plus three ContextResult::kTransientFailure out of CreateCommandBuffer.
 * The switch is not being ignored — it reaches the children, it is right there in
 * /proc/<gpu-pid>/cmdline — it just cannot present.
 *
 * DO NOT PIN "wayland" EITHER, however tempting after the above. Measured out of
 * a scratch copy of this directory, four pins x two sessions, reading the main
 * process's /memfd:wayland-* allocations and what the renderer can see over CDP:
 *
 *                            Wayland session            X11-only session
 *     pin "wayland"          window, dpr 1.5, 331KB     NO FRAME, dpr 1  <-- zombie
 *     pin "x11"              window, but the X11 GPU    window, dpr 1, 190KB
 *                            error above every launch
 *     no pin                 window, dpr 1.5, 331KB     window, dpr 1, 190KB
 *     from the session       window, dpr 1.5, 331KB     window, dpr 1, 190KB
 *
 * The top-right cell is the same silent zombie as the x11 one, aimed at everybody
 * who logs into X11: alive, serving, /health ok, no window, nothing in the log.
 * This repo publishes an AppImage and a .deb, so that is not a hypothetical
 * machine. "No pin" measures identically to choosing from the session; choosing
 * is kept because a file that says which backend it is beats one that leaves it
 * to a default that has already changed twice in this app's lifetime.
 *
 * On the machine this ships to the expression evaluates to "wayland", which is
 * exactly the one-word hand-patch that was confirmed working in the installed
 * asar. The source and the install now agree.
 *
 * The cost, which is real and is now paid: a Wayland client cannot position its
 * own window, the compositor does. Saved window POSITION is gone — see
 * APP_PLACES_ITS_WINDOW below, which stops pretending otherwise. Size, maximised
 * and fullscreen all still work. The argument that used to stand here was that
 * `xlsclients -l` listed agentglass before the upgrade, so it was already an X11
 * client under XWayland and pinning x11 changed nothing. That was true of
 * Electron 33 and did not survive Electron 43; it is written down so nobody
 * re-derives it and reverts.
 *
 * Wayland pays something back that was not expected: the primary monitor on the
 * machine this ships to is at fractional scale 1.5 (mutter's own DisplayConfig
 * says so), and a native Wayland client is told that where XWayland was not —
 * devicePixelRatio 1.5, a 2160x1350 buffer for a 1440x900 window. Under XWayland
 * it was dpr 1 and the compositor upscaled the result, which is where "small or
 * blurry" came from.

 * Software-composite the final frame on Linux.
 *
 * On some Linux GPU/compositor stacks Chromium's GPU compositor hands the window
 * stale or empty tiles — the whole UI reads as solid white until a repaint
 * (switching theme) forces them to redraw. Compositing the final frame on the
 * CPU sidesteps it. Linux only, and AGENTGLASS_GPU=1 opts back in.
 *
 * The price, MEASURED, because what used to be written here was wrong. This said
 * "GPU raster and WebGL still run… only the last composite is on the CPU". Half
 * of that is true. Read out of the running app through CDP SystemInfo.getInfo:
 *
 *                        default (this switch)   AGENTGLASS_GPU=1
 *     gpu_compositing    disabled_software       enabled
 *     rasterization      enabled                 enabled
 *     webgl              enabled_readback        enabled
 *     webgpu             enabled_readback        enabled
 *
 * So raster does survive, and WebGL does NOT: it drops to readback, where every
 * frame is copied off the GPU into system memory. And the thing that pays is not
 * what the old comment named — the radar and the dashboard charts are SVG, the
 * dashboard holds zero canvases — it is the TERMINAL, whose xterm WebGL renderer
 * (web/src/components/TerminalPanel.tsx) exists precisely to keep a fast-writing
 * shell off the CPU.
 *
 * Kept anyway, for now. Under native Wayland on this machine (AMD Radeon 890M,
 * Mesa 25.2.8, GNOME 46) the white-out did not appear in either mode across a
 * dark→light theme change, view switches, maximise, unmaximise, fullscreen,
 * windowed, minimise and restore — nine frames each way, every one with the
 * right mean colour and a clean log. That is an absence of evidence from one
 * session, not evidence of absence, and the bug it guards against is
 * intermittent and stack-dependent; it was also tuned on XWayland under Electron
 * 33, which is no longer the configuration that ships. Whoever removes it should
 * do it deliberately, run without it for a week, and get the terminal's
 * acceleration back as the reward.

     * Wayland surface (grim gets "compositor doesn't support
     * wlr-screencopy-unstable-v1", org.gnome.Shell.Screenshot answers
     * AccessDenied, the portal wants a click), so this was read off the browser's

  // the poll runs 40 times at 300ms, and a launch that shows no window reads as
  // an app that failed to start.
  //
  // Nothing in the shell needs the server before the window exists, and the UI
  // already copes with it being briefly absent: the live socket reconnects with
  // backoff and every panel's fetch has a retry or an honest loading state. So
  // the window comes up first and the server arrives underneath it.
