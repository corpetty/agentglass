//
// The scheme is not cosmetic. This used to be a loopback HTTP server on an
// EPHEMERAL port, which meant the renderer's origin changed on every launch --
// and localStorage is keyed by origin, so every restart handed the app an
// empty store: theme, display size, chats, drafts, the saved token and every
// preference, all silently reset. A fixed port would have fixed persistence
// but reintroduced the bug the ephemeral port was chosen to avoid (a second
// instance failing to bind). A custom scheme has neither problem: one stable
// origin and no port to contend for. Only one instance runs now (see the lock
// below), but the origin is what makes the store survive a restart.

 * Which windowing backend this app is, on Linux. Pinned, on purpose.
 *
 * What used to be here was `ozone-platform-hint=auto` plus
 * `enable-features=UseOzonePlatform`. Both were deleted rather than kept "just
 * in case": Chromium removed `--ozone-platform-hint` in M140 (= Electron 38,
 * `ui/ozone/public/ozone_switches.cc` now defines only `ozone-platform`,
 * `ozone-dump-file` and `ozone-override-screen-size`), and the
 * `UseOzonePlatform` feature no longer exists either. They were not merely
 * doing nothing — they were two lines telling the next reader that this file
 * chooses a backend, when it had stopped choosing anything.
 *
 * So it chooses one now, and it chooses it FROM THE SESSION. Not a constant —
 * a constant is wrong in one direction or the other, and both directions were
 * measured.
 *
 * DO NOT PIN "x11". That was the first attempt, for the reason below, and it
 * failed in the worst shape there is: on GNOME 46 / Wayland with Chromium 150 the
 * packaged app started, brought the sidecar up, served :4000, answered /health —
 * and never mapped a window. Nothing on screen, no crash, no non-zero exit; the
 * main process had connected to no display server at all. The GPU process says
 * why, and still does today:
 *     ui/base/x/x11_software_bitmap_presenter.cc:147
 *       XGetWindowAttributes failed for window 1
 * Without the CPU-compositing switch (so this is not the white-out workaround below) it is the
 * same, plus three ContextResult::kTransientFailure out of CreateCommandBuffer.
 * The switch is not being ignored — it reaches the children, it is right there in
 * /proc/<gpu-pid>/cmdline — it just cannot present.
 *
 * DO NOT PIN "wayland" EITHER, however tempting after the above. Measured out of
 * a scratch copy of this directory, four pins x two sessions, reading the main
 * process's /memfd:wayland-* allocations and what the renderer can see over CDP:
 *
 *                            Wayland session            X11-only session
 *     pin "wayland"          window, dpr 1.5, 331KB     NO FRAME, dpr 1  <-- zombie
 *     pin "x11"              window, but the X11 GPU    window, dpr 1, 190KB
 *                            error above every launch
 *     no pin                 window, dpr 1.5, 331KB     window, dpr 1, 190KB
 *     from the session       window, dpr 1.5, 331KB     window, dpr 1, 190KB
 *
 * The top-right cell is the same silent zombie as the x11 one, aimed at everybody
 * who logs into X11: alive, serving, /health ok, no window, nothing in the log.
 * This repo publishes an AppImage and a .deb, so that is not a hypothetical
 * machine. "No pin" measures identically to choosing from the session; choosing
 * is kept because a file that says which backend it is beats one that leaves it
 * to a default that has already changed twice in this app's lifetime.
 *
 * On the machine this ships to the expression evaluates to "wayland", which is
 * exactly the one-word hand-patch that was confirmed working in the installed
 * asar. The source and the install now agree.
 *
 * The cost, which is real and is now paid: a Wayland client cannot position its
 * own window, the compositor does. Saved window POSITION is gone — see
 * APP_PLACES_ITS_WINDOW below, which stops pretending otherwise. Size, maximised
 * and fullscreen all still work. The argument that used to stand here was that
 * `xlsclients -l` listed agentglass before the upgrade, so it was already an X11
 * client under XWayland and pinning x11 changed nothing. That was true of
 * Electron 33 and did not survive Electron 43; it is written down so nobody
 * re-derives it and reverts.
 *
 * Wayland pays something back that was not expected: the primary monitor on the
 * machine this ships to is at fractional scale 1.5 (mutter's own DisplayConfig
 * says so), and a native Wayland client is told that where XWayland was not —
 * devicePixelRatio 1.5, a 2160x1350 buffer for a 1440x900 window. Under XWayland
 * it was dpr 1 and the compositor upscaled the result, which is where "small or
 * blurry" came from.

 * GPU-composite the final frame on Linux, unless AGENTGLASS_GPU=0.
 *
 * On some Linux GPU/compositor stacks Chromium's GPU compositor hands the window
 * stale or empty tiles — the whole UI reads as solid white until a repaint
 * (switching theme) forces them to redraw. Compositing the final frame on the
 * CPU sidesteps it, and that used to be the default here. It is now the opt-out:
 * AGENTGLASS_GPU=0 puts the switch back for a stack that shows the white-out.
 *
 * The price, MEASURED, because what used to be written here was wrong. This said
 * "GPU raster and WebGL still run… only the last composite is on the CPU". Half
 * of that is true. Read out of the running app through CDP SystemInfo.getInfo:
 *
 *                        AGENTGLASS_GPU=0        default
 *     gpu_compositing    disabled_software       enabled
 *     rasterization      enabled                 enabled
 *     webgl              enabled_readback        enabled
 *     webgpu             enabled_readback        enabled
 *
 * So raster does survive, and WebGL does NOT: it drops to readback, where every
 * frame is copied off the GPU into system memory. And the thing that pays is not
 * what the old comment named — the radar and the dashboard charts are SVG, the
 * dashboard holds zero canvases — it is the TERMINAL, whose xterm WebGL renderer
 * (web/src/components/TerminalPanel.tsx) exists precisely to keep a fast-writing
 * shell off the CPU.
 *
 * Flipped to opt-out because a CPU-composited 4K window was the biggest single
 * idle cost measured on the desktop (the renderer's compositor plus the GPU
 * process reading WebGL back, about a third of a core). Under native Wayland on
 * this machine (AMD Radeon 890M, Mesa 25.2.8, GNOME 46) the white-out did not
 * appear in either mode across a dark→light theme change, view switches,
 * maximise, unmaximise, fullscreen, windowed, minimise and restore — nine frames
 * each way, every one with the right mean colour and a clean log. That is an
 * absence of evidence from one session, not evidence of absence, and the bug it
 * guards against is intermittent and stack-dependent; it was also tuned on
 * XWayland under Electron 33, which is no longer the configuration that ships.
 * If a solid-white window turns up, AGENTGLASS_GPU=0 is the first thing to try,
 * and the report belongs with the GPU/compositor it came from. Not measured
 * here: the CPU of each mode on a visible window, which needs frame callbacks.

 * up, and nobody has decided yet. The renderer could not tell those apart, so
 * it asked the network instead: one /health per boot, refused in the cold case
 * and logged by Chromium as an error whatever the caller does with it, plus a
 * second from ServerBanner probing on its own. A null report only ever follows

   * §5: the DevTools protocol itself, one call wide.
   *
   * The spec asks for a debugger, DOM breakpoints, a listener inspector, JS and
   * CSS coverage, a profiler, heap snapshots, source maps and paint layers —
   * and every one of those is a CDP domain that Chromium already implements.
   * Wrapping each in its own IPC handler would be nine handlers that all do the
   * same thing, and would be missing the tenth on the day somebody needs it.
   * So the protocol is relayed whole, and the ergonomic verbs on top of it
   * (`listeners`, `coverage`) are built in the panel where they are cheap to
   * add rather than here where each one costs a round of shell plumbing.
   *
   * The seat, and why this can refuse: a page has ONE debugger session. If a
   * person has their own inspector open on this guest, it is theirs — this
   * refuses rather than steals it, exactly as `ag:captureBrowser` and §4's
   * init-script relay do. Stealing it would close their DevTools out from
   * under them mid-debug, which is the kind of thing that makes somebody stop
   * trusting a tool for good.
   *
   * The event buffer exists because CDP is a stream and this relay is a
   * request. `Debugger.paused`, `Runtime.consoleAPICalled`, a DOM breakpoint
   * firing — all of those arrive when they arrive, and an agent that has to
   * be holding a connection to see them is back to the polling §1 removed.
   * They queue here, newest last, and `cdp --events` drains them.

 * A LANE HOST: a window nobody sees, where an agent's browser tab lives.
 *
 * It loads the same app with `#lane=<id>`, which mounts only a webview and the

 * Measured on Linux/Wayland (Electron 43), a webview guest in the host:
 *
 *   show:false             rAF 1/s, Page.captureScreenshot 9/10 time out,
 *                          capturePage 10/10 time out, screencast 0 frames
 *   show:false + offscreen rAF 30/s, captureScreenshot p50 100 ms,
 *                          capturePage p50 33 ms, screencast 59 frames in 2 s
 *
 * A hidden window gets no frames because the compositor never asks it for one,
 * and `backgroundThrottling` does not change that. An offscreen window paints
 * on its own clock, so the guest inside it does too. `stayHidden` on
 * capturePage made no difference. Moving a real window off screen was not an
 * option: a Wayland client cannot place itself, and a window on a workspace
 * nobody looks at gets no frames either.
 *
 * Driven through the CLI in a lane (20 reps, main window on a workspace nobody
 * looks at): observe p50 83 ms, click 250, fill 83, shot 188, screencast 59
 * frames in 2 s, none failed on the lane's side.
 *
 * Ceilings: offscreen paints in software (no GPU for the guest); one webview
 * per host; and a page the guest navigates to reports visibilityState "hidden"
 * (the first document is "visible", the new process after a cross-site load
 * is not, and neither setBackgroundThrottling(false), startPainting, focus
 * emulation nor a lifecycle override changed it), so a page that pauses when
 * hidden will pause here though it keeps painting.
 *
 * The server decides how many lanes there may be and which are idle
 * (server/src/lanes.ts); this is only the window, made and destroyed when the
 * app's own renderer asks (`ag:laneOpen`, `ag:laneClose`). The count and the

     * The strip at the top of this window already carries the project, the
     * fleet, the plan meters and the clock; a second bar above it holding
     * nothing but three buttons is 30px of chrome saying nothing. So the buttons
     * move in with everything else and the strip becomes the drag region.
     *
     * macOS keeps its traffic lights — they are a system affordance people
     * expect exactly where they are, and `hiddenInset` leaves them in place over
     * our own bar, which pads itself past them. Everywhere else the window is
     * frameless and the buttons below are the whole story, which is why they are
     * wired rather than decorative: with `frame: false` there is no other way to
     * minimise, maximise or close.
     *
     * `roundedCorners` is deliberately not set, and that is a decision rather
     * than an oversight. Electron 43 newly applies it on Linux — its own typedef
     * went from `@platform darwin` in 33 to "on Linux, rounded corners are only
     * drawn when the desktop environment supports client-side decorations", and
     * GNOME 46 does CSD — so the default `true` reaches this window for the first
     * time on this upgrade. Checked before leaving it: the app was put in
     * Porcelain (white) and all four corners read back at 8x. The nearest pixel
     * of anything the app draws is the logo, ~7 device px in from the top and ~18
     * from the left; the window buttons are further in still, and the outer 20px
     * of every corner is flat background. A corner radius has nothing to clip.
     *
     * Not verifiable here: GNOME 46 refuses every route to a photograph of a
     * Wayland surface (grim gets "compositor doesn't support
     * wlr-screencopy-unstable-v1", org.gnome.Shell.Screenshot answers
     * AccessDenied, the portal wants a click), so this was read off the browser's
     * own compositing surface. If the round is applied above that surface it
     * would not appear there — but it would land on those same flat corner
     * pixels, which is why the measurement still answers the question.
