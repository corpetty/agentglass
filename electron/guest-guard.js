// Its own file, and that is the point rather than tidiness. `main.js` is 1200
// lines of shell — a lock, a scheme, a sidecar, IPC, a window — and this is the
// twenty lines of it that decide whether a page the app did not write can hold
// the app's bridge. Read in one screen, with nothing else in the screen.
//
// It is also the only way to test it. main.js is the Electron entry point:
// importing it takes the single-instance lock and registers protocol schemes
// against an `electron` module that does not exist under bun, which is why
// server/test/desktop-token.test.ts has to lift functions out of it with a
// regex. This file requires nothing, so a test can just import it — see
// web/test/browser-guest-guard.test.ts. docs/BROWSER-TIER1.md asked for that
// test when the browser shipped and it did not exist until the Electron 43
// upgrade needed to prove the guard survived.
//
// CommonJS with no build step, like main.js, because main.js requires it. Add
// nothing here that needs bundling, and keep it in `build.files` in
// package.json — left out of the asar, the app does not start.

/**
 * Everything enabling `<webview>` costs, paid back in one place.
 *
 * A guest is a page the app did not write, so it gets nothing: no preload (it
 * would inherit the `window.agentglass` bridge and with it the API token), no
 * Node, no relaxed web security, its own session, and a src that has already
 * been checked. Fail closed — a src or partition that is not recognised is
 * refused rather than corrected, because a renderer bug that can choose either
 * is the whole attack.
 *
 * `will-attach-webview` is the only hook that runs before the guest exists;
 * attributes set in the markup are advisory until this handler agrees with
 * them. Traced again at Electron 43 before the upgrade: `createGuest` in
 * lib/browser/guest-view-manager.ts still builds `webPreferences`, emits this
 * event, honours `defaultPrevented`, and then spreads the SAME object into
 * `webContents.create()` — so every mutation below still lands, and returning
 * false here still stops the guest existing.
 *
 * @returns true if the guest may attach (webPreferences has been hardened in
 *          place), false if the caller must preventDefault.
