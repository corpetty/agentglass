// the app's bridge. Read in one screen, with nothing else in the screen.

// It is also the only way to test it. main.js is the Electron entry point:
// importing it takes the single-instance lock and registers protocol schemes
// against an `electron` module that does not exist under bun, which is why
// server/test/desktop-token.test.ts has to lift functions out of it with a
// regex. This file requires nothing, so a test can just import it — see
// web/test/browser-guest-guard.test.ts. docs/BROWSER-TIER1.md asked for that
// test when the browser shipped and it did not exist until the Electron 43
// upgrade needed to prove the guard survived.
//
// CommonJS with no build step, like main.js, because main.js requires it. Add
// nothing here that needs bundling, and keep it in `build.files` in
// package.json — left out of the asar, the app does not start.
