# Finding and stopping an installed agentglass desktop instance.

# Sourced by install-local.sh (and exercised by server/test/install-stop.test.ts),
# which is why it is a library rather than inline: the interesting part is not
# the install, it is knowing which processes belong to this install and waiting
# for them to actually be gone.
#
# Expects APP to be set to the install directory (…/agentglass-desktop).

# The variables the running server DERIVES for itself, which must never reach an
# app this script launches.
#
# AGENTGLASS_TOKEN is the one that bites. `rotateToken` refuses when it is set —
# correctly: rotating a file the server does not read would report a revoke that
# did not happen — so "Revoke this link" answers with a note about an environment
# variable the user never set and cannot find. That cost an Electron inspector
# session to establish, because /proc/<pid>/environ shows the exec-time snapshot
# and told us it was not there.
#
# One list, used twice, because the two uses are not the same thing and only
# doing both is enough: it is filtered OUT of what gets replayed, and it is
# `env -u`'d out of the launch. Not replaying it was the whole of the previous
# fix, and it protected nothing — the installer inherits these from the shell
# that started it (server/src/selfupdate.ts spawns the update script with the
# sidecar's environment), and `env FOO=bar cmd` ADDS to that environment, it
# does not replace it. Measured: with the seven exported around it, a reopened
# instance had all seven, replay list or no replay list.
#
# server/src/selfupdate.ts holds the same list for the same reason and
# server/test/install-stop.test.ts fails if the two ever drift.
