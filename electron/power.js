/**
 * Keep the machine awake while an agent works, and only then.
 *
 * Three modes: `on` (stay awake continuously), `agent` (stay awake only while
 * something is actually working — the one that matters), `off` (normal
 * system sleep). Whether "something is working" polls the server's own
 * `/agents/working`, which is built from what already tracks that — a pane
 * mid-turn, an understudy run still `running` — rather than a fourth source
 * of truth invented here.
 *
 * The assertion has two halves on Linux, because neither alone is the whole
 * promise:
 *   - `systemd-inhibit` is a *child process* holding a logind inhibitor lock
 *     for as long as it runs — two of them, one per lock, because the two
 *     locks need different modes (see `spawnInhibit`). `handle-lid-switch`
 *     is deliberate: closing the lid must not end a run.
 *   - Electron's `powerSaveBlocker` covers the display, which systemd does not.
 *
 * A PERSON'S OWN SUSPEND WINS. The sleep lock is held in BLOCK-WEAK mode:
 * logind enforces it against its own idle action and against other users,
 * and not against a request from the user who holds it — so `systemctl
 * suspend` from the menu goes through while an agent works, and the machine
 * still does not doze off on its own. Plain block was the first version, and
 * it did what it says to every suspend, that one included: with an agent
 * mid-turn the menu entry answered "Operation inhibited" and nothing happened,
 * with nothing on screen saying why. Measured on the owner's laptop.
 *
 * `block-weak` arrived in systemd 257. An older logind refuses the mode at
 * once ("Invalid mode specification", exit 1, measured on 261 with a bogus
 * mode), and the lock is then taken in plain BLOCK mode instead — which,
 * before 257, is the same thing under the old name: org.freedesktop.login1(5)
 * says block locks were "honoured only by unprivileged users, excluding the
 * user owning the inhibitor", and that 257 enforces them on everyone and
 * offers the old behaviour as block-weak. So on a logind too old for the
 * weak spelling, block already lets the owner's own suspend through. The
 * first version fell back to DELAY, which holds a suspend for
 * InhibitDelayMaxSec and then lets it go — nothing at all, on every Debian 12
 * and Ubuntu 24.04 (systemd 252 and 255). The lid switch has no weak or
 * delay mode in logind, and blocking it is what was wanted.
 *
 * Three failure modes are the whole difference between this working and this
 * being a lie, and each gets its own paragraph below: `systemd-inhibit` not
 * being installed, a suspend killing the child that was holding the lock, and
 * a dead agent's stale "working" status holding the machine awake forever.
 */
/*
 * READ OFF THE MODULE, NOT DESTRUCTURED, AND EVERY USE GUARDED.
 *
 * `powerMonitor` and `powerSaveBlocker` are main-process Electron APIs, and
 * this file is loaded by anything that loads main.js — including the harness
 * that runs the shell under plain node with an electron stub to check that a
 * broken sidecar is REPORTED rather than fatal. Destructured, the stub yields
 * `undefined` and the first `.on` throws out of `app.whenReady()`, which turned
 * three "the app survives" tests into "the app exits 1".
 *
 * That is not a test accident, it is the rule this feature has to obey: keeping
 * the machine awake is never worth the app not starting. So both are optional
 * here and every call site treats absence as "this half of the assertion is not
 * available", the same way a missing `systemd-inhibit` is treated below.
